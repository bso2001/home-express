<div class="bso-lyric-column">
the pain of need
defines one's creed
you're locked inside
biding your time
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
it's all what's left
to the way you feel
life's passed you by
and you'll have no change
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
now into REMs
you have hidden
in fear of what
has been spoken
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
the joke's been cast
out of context
you're state won't last
the final verse has begun
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
knowing that
your ways won't change
realize
things won't be the same
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
now you sit through
this lonely dirge
does this feel real?
all the pain you feel
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
combat the tears
cast out your fears
realize their needs
say you'll act alone
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
stop hurting
the one's that you say you love
there's more to one's
own blind judgement
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
feel their needs
open up your heart
step back, assess it
from the very start
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
knowing that
you were wrong
at last
you'll say you're wrong
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
going to your ruin
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
now you look through
this empty door
is what you see
all worth living for?
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
step back a ways
then count your days
you feel the haze
is this the way?
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
stop hurting
the one's that you say you love
there's more to your
own blind judgement
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
feel their needs
open up your heart
step back, assess it
right from the very start
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
knowing that
your life won't change
realize
you will be the same
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
going to your ruin
