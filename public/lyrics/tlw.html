<div class="bso-lyric-title"> The Long Way </div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
how long will you wait
for your last chance?
(how many more?)
how long will it take 'til you see?
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
so many roads that
lead you nowhere
you planned it all
so carefully
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
who will save you
from fallin' now?
you've been runnin' so long
it's a mystery to me
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
taking the long way
taking the wrong way
keep coming back
to where we began
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
wherever you run
you take the wrong way
before you've begun
before you find the key
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
that unlocks the door
that takes you homeward
like a river that runs
out to sea
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
there's no way home
anymore
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
how far can you run now
how do you run now baby
how will you know
when you've reached the end
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
how long will you wait
for the last chance?
how long will it take
before you see
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
all of the roads that
lead you nowhere
while you're trying
to be free
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you always seem to take the long way...
