<div class="bso-lyric-title"> One More Fool </div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
here's one more fool for the road
there's one more story untold
all that glittering gold brings
cold steel straight on through your heart
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
somebody's taking your place
before you can finish the race
a voice in your head says
too late to illuminate
the trail of broken hearts
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
one night you're feeling so much older
one dream she's whispering at your shoulder
then you find you're just a pawn in her game
and the winner is always the same
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
she's dressing to kill tonight
spinning her web with delight
she's running every table in sight
night life is the game
she's out there on the prowl			
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
one night you're feeling so much older
one dream she's whispering at your shoulder
and then you find you're just a pawn in her game
and the winner is always the same
</div>
