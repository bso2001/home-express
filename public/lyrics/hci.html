<div class="bso-lyric-column">
let's go for a ride
it's a long way down
when you start at the top of the slide
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
let's see what's inside
turn it on, stand back
and then watch as the worlds collide
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
how can i ever know it?
if you're afraid to show it
we need to fan this fire
we need a new desire
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
time after time
you bring me up to the line
then you're changing your mind
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
let's try second gear
take it out on the road
and take it anywhere away from here
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
we can climb to the top
let's play with some fire
let's touch a live wire tonight
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
if we cut out of here
there's a warm wind blowing
the stars are glowing tonight
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
just tell me how could i know it?
are you just afraid to show it?
we need to fan this fire
we need a new desire
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
it's your love
that i'm sure of
i need more of
what i'm feeling
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
wake up
let's take it up
baby
there's a storm that's breaking
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
let's go
'cause i know
if we try
find a way to break through
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
your love
i'm so sure of
i need more of
what i'm feeling with you
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
but how i can ever know it? ....
