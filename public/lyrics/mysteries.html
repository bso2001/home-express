<div class="bso-lyric-column">
take to the air
everyone's there
as you hold their attentions locked
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
making the rounds
through an ocean of sounds
seems everything has stopped again
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
so light up the stage
with colors deranged
steal the mist of dawn to hide in
and you won't know where you've been
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
one life is all you'll ever need
realize you're free
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
the slide's getting steep
trying to keep it
from going out of style
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
for a twenty buck fare
they'll sit and stare
as you try and raise a smile
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
but the scene in the sky
a perennial lie
even truth's designed to be misleading
in these modern mysteries
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
one life is all you'll ever need
realize you're free
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
after the fall
the result of stalling
too far over your head
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you'll see in the street
the faces you meet
will look away instead
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
but running away
from the match of the day
is to take a road so long
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
and as kings always choose
<i>après moi le déluge</i>
you'll be sorry when i'm gone
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
one life is all you'll ever need
realize you're free
