midnight
moonlight
in the garden of stone
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
feel the cold wind
clouds spin
and you're chilled to the bone
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
take it up
bring it down
try to get your feet on the ground
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
live it up
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
it's the night of the knives
they'll never take you alive
you'd better run for your life
the only way to survive
this night
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
in the jungle
when you stumble
they carry you away
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
in the quick sand
of a strange land
where everything is grey
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
when you feel that
hot breath
at the back of your neck
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
watch the crowd run
as you're the last one
to crawl out of the wreck
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
but it's the night of the lies
all the lies in their eyes
they walk around hypnotized
hypnotized
mesmerized
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you'd better run for your life
the only way to survive
this night
</div>
