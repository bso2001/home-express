<div class="bso-lyric-column">
it's all upside down
i can't hear a sound
staring at the wall
i wait for your call
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
time is just crawling away
wondering if i should stay
life can turn you around
but i will be all right
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
i've got a new disguise
it's all in my eyes
you can see through me
so easily
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
it's like a ball and chain
heavy and insane
life it can turn you around
but i will be all right
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
how long can we pretend?
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
the promises we made
have turned into a bad charade
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
now have we really reached the end?
we can turn away or try again
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you always said you'd see it through
i never lost my faith in you
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
searching for something left to say
when i hear the words just drift away
</div>
