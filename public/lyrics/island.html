<div class="bso-lyric-title"> Life on the Island <span style="font-size: 13px;">(Olsson)</span> </div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
life on the island
millions of miles
away from the nearest shore
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
my, this is my land
left you to yours
and i won't be back anymore
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
if you could reach me here
a thousand tales to tell
about this life outside
the laws that lead you
through your every day
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
fly over my island
you won't see me waiting
no not from your point of view
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
but i'm alive on this island
with survival so hard
just doing what i've got to do
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
if you could reach me here
a thousand lies dispelled
about the truth of being
far removed from your
mechanized malaise
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
i am an island
adrift in this sea of humanity
waiting for you
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
try a life on the island
i'm waiting and watching
and wondering what i should do
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
please try to reach me here
a thousand miles away
it's just outside the bounds of
hopes you cling to
'til your passing day
</div>
