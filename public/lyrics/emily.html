i always looked for you
when skies would turn grey
side by side
guiding my way
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
but this line
that you draw in the sand
drifted away
right through my hands
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
i still love you
say what you will
i just can't seem to
break through this chill
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
high or low
the thorn or the rose
you change every day
so god only knows
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>

i can't find the way to save you
i can't find a way to save you
the words we left unsaid
you know how i tried
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
i never thought that i
would ever be the lonely one without you
i never thought that i
would ever have to live my life without you here
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
how could i know that i
would ever be the lonely one without you
and when i wonder why
everything i was is lost without you here
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you run for the light
then you hide in the dark
it's the thrill that excites
when you're chasing that spark
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
high or low
the thorn or the rose
you change every day
so god only knows
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
