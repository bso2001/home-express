<div class="bso-lyric-column">
is there life within
these crumbling walls?
your life's obscurity
not known to all
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
on the switch, the charge
the energy stalls
your past is calling
history now falls
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you've been searching
though you're so far away
cause for direction
the blind leading the blind
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
last chance alone now
don't let it slip away
no time to think now
one flick and you're snatched away
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
the sentence given to you
was your just return
the victims only wish
they could see you burn
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
your time in court
was a waste of time and money
phone's disconnected, shades are drawn
time to die
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
you've been searching
though you're so far away
cause for distinction
the blind leading the blind
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
last chance alone now
don't let it slip away
no time to think now
one flick and you're snatched away
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you hear the crumbling walls
you feel the crumbling of the walls
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you feel the passion
you see the end
your last reaction
this is the end
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
all the walls closing in
crumbling
crumbling down
