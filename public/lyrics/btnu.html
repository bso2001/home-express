<div class="bso-lyric-title"> Burn the Night Up </div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
you can burn the night up
or you can take it right up to the edge
you can light up the crowd
but still you're alone
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you got a fire that's burning
you got a heart that's yearning
still you're not learning
you'll never be free
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you can run with the night life
you can cut with your jack knife
pretend you're the good wife
but you'll never be free
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
there is a place waiting
an empty space fading
in the heat of the night
when you're feeling all right
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
you say you wanna be free
you wanna see what you'll see
the game is the same
it's just the faces that change
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you sow what you reap
it's yours to lose or keep
better take a good look
before you leap
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
you can fly with the night owls
you can land with your new pals
you can dance 'til the wolf howls
you'll still wake up alone
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
it's all taking or giving
you've got a new way of living
it seems the faster you run
the more you come undone
</div>
