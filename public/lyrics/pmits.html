dawn is breaking
ground is shaking
pack up your bags
now i'm gonna break it to you
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
can't turn back
now i've learned that
it's a new day
now i'm gonna break it to you
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
there's no glory
in this story
i got some wings
now they're gonna take me away
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
burning bridges on the fly
seeing visions in the sky
like signs from a prophecy
before the well runs dry
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
take me out to the light
point me into the sky
</div>
