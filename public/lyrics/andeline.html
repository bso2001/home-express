the words that you speak are deceiving
that look's not in your eyes anymore
it's a feeling that i just can't believe in
whenever you walk out the door
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
andeline, andeline
are you thinking 'bout leaving this time?
andeline, andeline
or is it all just in my mind?
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
sometimes we're like ships on the ocean
just passing along in the night
it's a race that we run in slow motion
but i don't have the strength for the fight
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
andeline, andeline
do i see the truth or am i just blind?
are they lies?
are they lies?
or is all just in my mind?
</div>
<div class="bso-lyric-column">
drawn to the fire like a moth to a flame
i feel it burning into my soul
there's a fever in my brain
it drives me insane
i've fallen through a bottomless hole
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
sometimes we just take it for granted
there's a light at the end of the night
it comes down to the last one left standing
does it matter in the end who was right?
<p style="margin-top:-10px;"></p>
andeline, andeline
are you thinking 'bout leaving this time?
andeline, andeline
or is it all just in my mind?
