                             Afterglow    (Genesis)

     G  /  Gmaj7  /  C/G  /  Gsus  /  G  /  Gmaj7  /  C/G  /  F  D

    G         Gmaj7     C/G           Gsus
     Like the dust that settles all around me

    G       Gmaj7      C/G   F   D
     I must find a new home

    G             Gmaj7      C/G             Gsus
     The ways and holes that used to give me shelter

    E            A         B  /  G  D
     Are all as one to me now

         Eb                Fm                   Db        Eb
     But I, I would search everywhere, just to hear your call

                     Fm
     And walk upon stranger roads than this one

           Db                     Eb      Bb       C  /  Gsus  /
     In a world I used to know before, I miss you more

    G        Gmaj7   C/G           Gsus
     Than the sun reflecting on my pillow

    G             Gmaj7         C/G   F   D
     Bringing the warmth of new life

    G        Gmaj7       C/G         Gsus
     And the sounds that echoed all around me

    E             A                 B  /  G  D
     I caught a glimpse of in the night

         Eb                 Fm                    Db      Eb
     But now, now I've lost everything, I give to you my soul

                    Fm
     The meaning of all that I believed before

        Db                        Eb       Bb       C
     Escapes me in this world of none, no thing no-one

                        Dm                   Bb        C
     And I would search everywhere, just to hear your call

                      Dm
     And walk upon stranger roads than this one

           Bb                     C
     In a world I used to know before

                       Dm                    Bb      C
     For now I've lost everything, I give to you my soul

                    Dm
     The meaning of all that I believed before

        Bb                        C       G        A
     Escapes me in this world of none, I miss you more

      D  /  Dmaj7  /  G  /  Dsus  /  D  /  Dmaj7  /  G  /  C  A
     [                                                           ]  Repeat
