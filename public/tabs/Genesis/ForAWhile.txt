                       For A While    (Tony Banks)

     C  /  Em  /  Am  /  F  /  C  /  Em  /  Am  /  F  /

                C      Em  Am  F        C          Em    Am    F
     I feel it leading me,   away to I don't know where

                 C        Em  Am         F          Bb7        Cmaj7(3rd fret)
     I might be back someday,   but the people and things will change

         Eb             Dm         C  /  Em  /  Am  /  F  /
     And no one will remember me then

                    C    Em  Am     F            C         Em    Am    F
     Don't need no sympathy,   for soon I'll forget everything

                C      Em  Am       F         Bb7        Cmaj7(3rd fret)
     I feel it fading now,   and I see in the eyes of my love

      Eb               Dm         C  /  Cm  /
     Tears for how it might have been

   Ab              Gm        Csus  Cm  Ab            Gm        Csus   Cm
     It sure felt good for a while,      yes it was good for a while

   Ab             Gm      Fm      Gm          Fm       Gm           C  Em  Am  F
     I found somebody to take my hand to the promised land of your love

                  C         Em  Am   F             C         Em    Am    F
     Now as the night draws in,   a dark with no promise of dawn

                C         Em  Am      F         Bb7        Cmaj7(3rd fret)
     I feel my eyes grow dim,   as I see in the eyes of my love

      Eb               Dm         C  /  Cm  /
     Tears for how it might have been

   Ab              Gm        Csus  Cm  Ab            Gm        Csus   Cm
     It sure felt good for a while,      yes it was good for a while

   Ab             Gm      Fm      Gm          Fm       Gm          Csus   Cm
     I found somebody to take my hand to the promised land of your love

   Ab            Gm        Csus  Cm  Ab              Gm        Csus   Cm
     Yes it was good for a while,      it sure felt good for a while

   Ab             Gm      Fm      Gm          Fm       Gm           C  Em  Am  F
     I found somebody to take my hand to the promised land of your love

      C  /  Em  /  Am  /  F  /
     [                          ]    Repeat and fade
