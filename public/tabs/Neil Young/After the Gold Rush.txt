
After the Goldrush
Neil Young


 Intro:
 D(addE) D G    (x2)

 G       D                            G             
 Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armour coming,

        D                 G     
 Sayin' something about a queen.

             D                    A                 
 There where peasants singin' and drummers drummin' 

         G                A    
 And the archer split the tree.

             Bm              C         
 There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun

          G               C      
 that was floating on the breeze.

 D                     A          
 Look at Mother Nature on the run 

        C             G    
 In the nineteen seventies.

 D                     A          
 Look at Mother Nature on the run 

        C             G    
 In the nineteen seventies.

                                     
 I was lying in a burned out basement
 With a full moon in my eye
 I was hoping for replacement
 When the sun burst through the sky
 There was a band playing in my head
 And I felt like getting high
 I was thinking about what a friend had said
 I was hoping it was a lie
 Thinking about what friend had said
 I was hoping it was a lie
                            
 Horn solo (lasts one verse)

 Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceship flying
 In the yellow haze of the sun
 There were children crying and colours flying
 All around the chosen one
 All in a dream, all in a dream
 The loading had begun
 Flying mother nature's silver seed
 To a new home in the sun
 Flying mother nature's silver seed
 To a new home

 Intro: DaddE -> D
 In other words hammer-on the first string as you hit the opening D.

Lyrics
 Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armour coming,
 Sayin' something about a queen.
 There where peasants singin' and drummers drummin' 
 And the archer split the tree.
 There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
 that was floating on the breeze.
 Look at Mother Nature on the run 
 in the nineteen seventies.
 Look at Mother Nature on the run 
 In the nineteen seventies.
 
 I was lying in a burned out basement
 With a full moon in my eye
 I was hoping for replacement
 When the sun burst through the sky
 There was a band playing in my head
 And I felt like getting high
 I was thinking about what a friend had said
 I was hoping it was a lie
 Thinking about what friend had said
 I was hoping it was a lie
                            
 Horn solo (lasts one verse)

 Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceship flying
 In the yellow haze of the sun
 There were children crying and colours flying
 All around the chosen one
 All in a dream, all in a dream
 The loading had begun
 Flying mother nature's silver seed
 To a new home in the sun
 Flying mother nature's silver seed
 To a new home
