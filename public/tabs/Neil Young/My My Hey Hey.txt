 Out of the blue and into the black
 They give you this, but you pay for that
 And once you've gone you can't ever come back
 When you're out of the blue
 and into the black.

 The King is gone but he's not forgotten
 This is the story of Johnny Rotten
 It's better to burn out than it is to rust
 The King is gone but he's not forgotten.
