 (intro)verse:

 D          A/D          G        D      
 We've been through some things together,

 Bm             G        A             
 With trunks of memories still to come.

 D        A/D             G      D       
 We found things to do in stormy weather.

 Bm   A       D    
 Long may you run. 

        
 chorus:
 D            A/D  G        D        
 Long may you run, long may you run, 

 Bm             G            A    
 Although these changes have come.

 D                      A/D    
 With your chrome heart shinin'

 G      D    Bm   A       D    
 in the sun, long may you run. 

 G Bb
   

 Well it was back in Blind River in nineteen sixtytwo 
 When I last saw you alive.
 But we missed that ship on the long decline.
 Long may you run.

 chorus:
 
 D Dsus4 D

 verse:

 Maybe the Beach Boys have got you now
 With those waves singin' Caroline.
 Rollin' down that empty ocean road,
 Get into the surf on time.
