I caught you knocking at my cellar door,

G/B                      Gm/Bb
I love you, baby, can I have some more?

C F              Esus4  E      
Oh the damage done.

I hit the city and I lost my band,
I watched the needle take another man,
Gone, gone, the damage done.

I sing the song because I love the man,
I know that some of you don't understand;
milk-blood to keep from runnin' out.

I've seen The Needle And The Damage Done,
A little part of it in everyone,
But every junkie's like a settin' sun.
