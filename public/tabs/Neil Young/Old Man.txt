 FM7                                     D          
 Old man look at my life, I'm a lot like you were       x2

 D F C G  D F C F

DWB: (try a quick F-G at the end of the phrase on the way back to D)
              
 D       F               
 Old man look at my life 

 C                       G           
 Twenty four and there's so much more

 D               F       
 Live alone in a paradise

      C                 F
 That makes me think of two

DWB: (try a quick F-G at the end of the verse on the way back to D)

 D          F           
 Love lost, such a cost,

 C                   G              
 Give me things that don't get lost.

 D                C               
 Like a coin that won't get tossed

 F               G   
 Rollin' home to you.


 D Am7 Em7 G D/F#

DWB: (Between to D and Am7, try Dsus4->D->D9->D, pulling-off the high E from the 3rd fret to 2nd fret to open E, then a quick punch on the 2nd fret again)
       
 D                                    Am7      Em7  G
 Old man take a look at my life I'm a lot like you

 D                             Am7       Em7       G 
 I need someone to love me the whole day through

 D                                   Am7         Em7  
 Oh, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true.

 D F C G  D F C F

(DWB: play a quick F-G at the end of the phrase on the way back to D)
                              
 Lullabies, look in your eyes,
 Run around the same old town.
 Doesn't mean that much to me 
 To mean that much to you
 I've been first and last
 Look at how the time goes past.
 But I'm all alone at last.
 Rolling home to you.

 Old man look at my life, I'm a lot like you were  x2 (intro chords)

D F C G

D       

 notes :
 FM7: x00560
 Dsus4: x00233
 D9: x00320
 Am7: x002010
 Em7: 022030

 FM7 is x00560, and you repeatedly hammer-on the third (G) string (0h5)
 The mention of Dsus4 is to indicate that you should fiddle around with the
 high E string, between D, Dsus4 and D9.

(DWB: I made the corrections he notes in the next paragraph, and fixed up the ending)

Just looking at the file right now, i wonder if the line: D F C G  D F C G
 (or D F C G x2 )  is correct - strikes me it should end in F. hmmm
 
If you make any additions or corrections - let me know of them!
 cheers! rcwoods@unix1.tcd.ie
