     (Repeat the above measures..)
     
     Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have kicked you around some.
     Tell me why you wanna lay there, revel in your abandon.
     
     Honey, it don't make no difference to me.
     Baby, everybody's had to fight to be free.
     You see, you don't have to live like a refugee.
     No baby, you don't have to live like a refugee.
     
     E

     Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have kicked you around some.
     Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped, tied-up, taken away, and held for
     ransom.
     
     Honey, it don't really matter to me.
     Baby, everybody's had to fight to be free.
     You see, you don't have to live like a refugee.
     No, you don't have to live like a refugee.
     Baby, you don't have to live like a refugee.
