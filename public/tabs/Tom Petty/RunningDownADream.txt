Signature Riff: use throughout the entire song.
          I do it like this: on the top (low E string)
                                     (play power E chord)
          E 0--7--0--6--0--5--0--3--0---------------

          Verse1:
                 E
                 It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
                             D                 E
                 I had the radio on, I was drivin'

                 The trees went back, me and Del were singin'
                           D                  E
                 Little Runaway, I was so blind

          Chorus:        D       G       E
                 Yeah, Runnin' down a dream
                  E           G       A
                 Never would come to me
                 D          G       E
                 Workin' on a mystery
                 E          G         A
                 Goin' wherever it leads
                 D          G       E
                 Runnin' down a dream


          Verse2:
                  E
                  I felt so good, like anything was possible
                         D                        E
                  Hit cruise control, and rub my eyes

                  Last three days, the rain was unstoppable
                          D                       E
                  (It) was always cold, no sunshine

          Repeat Chorus
          Break: It is just C (riff) D (riff) E (riff)  Play 2X

          Verse3:
                 E
                 I rolled on, the sky grew dark
                             D                        E
                 I put the pedal down, to make some time

                 There's something good, waiting down this road
                           D                 E
                 I'm pickin' up, whatever is mine

          Repeat chorus 2X, then Break part, and add SOLO!
