VERSE 2
Well yeah I might've chased a couple women around
All it ever got me was down
Yeah, then there were those that made me feel good
But never as good as I feel right now
Baby you're the only one that's ever known how
to make me wanna live like I wanna live now
I said yeh, yeh, yeh yeh yeh yeh

CHORUS
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you see one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
