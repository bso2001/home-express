INTO THE GREAT WIDE OPEN
TOM PETTY
=================================================================
 
The intro and first few bars of the verse seem to be the following:
 
    Em  Em? Em7 Em6
 
e---0-----------------
b---0-----------------          The chord names are probably a bit 
g---0-----------------                dodgy but - hey. If you play this 
d---2----1---0--------                on an acoustic 12 string (like TP's 
a---2----2---2---4----                nice Martin one ...) it sounds ok.
e---0----0---0---0----
 
 
 
Em    Em?            Em7           Em6
Eddie waited till he finished high school
Em         Em?        Em7      Em6
He went to Hollywood, got a tattoo
Am       Am/G               Am/F#     Am/G
He met a girl out there with a tattoo too
    G          F    C       G C G
The future was wide open.
 
Em         Em?               Em7        Em6
They moved into a place they both could afford 
Em         Em?                Em7         Em6
He found a nightclub he could work at the door
Am        Am/G            Am/F#          Am/G
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords
    G   F       C          G C G     G C GD
The sky was the limit.
 
G        C          D(sus4)  G          Em       D     Am
Into the great wide open,    under them skies of blue
G          C          D(sus4)    G         F     Em     A
Out in the great wide open,    a rebel without a clue.
 
 
(instrum: play the intro riff and end with G then A - I think)
 
The papers said Ed always played from the heart
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart
They made a record and it went in the charts
The sky was the limit.
 
His leather jacket had chains that would jingle
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled.
Their A&R man said "I don't hear a single."
The future was wide open.
 
Into the great wide open, under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open, a rebel without a clue.
 
Into the great wide open,  under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open, a rebel without a clue.

final flourish: G C G   G C G.
