(Ebm)I've been here since (Ebm7) long ago 
(Ebm6) waiting for the B end
(Ebm)I don't need to (Ebm7)have a home 
(Ebm6)but I could use a friend

(Ebm)So many (Fm+5) people they don't (Abm) give a (Bbm) damn
(B)They look (Db) away when they see (E) what I (B) am
I've been like half a man but I could be whole
Won't you befriend this solitary soul

(Abm7)Got a lot of (Abm7sus) breezes left to blow (Abm7) (Abmsus7)
(Db11)Where I'm (Db)going I don't know (Db11) (Db)
Got a lot of heartache got a show
What it's like you'll never know
To be the solitary soul

I've been here since long ago buried in my tears
Feels like I've walked alone for a thousand years

So many people they don't give a damn
They look away when they see what I am
I've been like half a man but I could be whole
Won't you befriend this solitary soul

Got a lot of breezes left to blow
Where I'm going I don't know
Got a lot of heartache got a show
What it's like you'll never know

Got a lot of breezes left to blow
Where I'm going I don't know
Got a lot of heartache got a show
What it's like you'll never know
To be the solitary soul


(Ebm) I see your (Db) heart
(B) I know what you've (Abm) been through
(Gb) I know (Bb) you
Come be a part
You know you belong here
So dry your tears because

(Db11)Love beyond (Db) words - Can fill your heart
(Db11)Love beyond (Db) words - You'll feel a part
(Abm)Love beyond (Bbm) words - You won't be (B) alone (Bbsus) anymore (Bb)

I see your heart
I know what you've been through
I know you
Come be a part
You know you belong here
So dry your tears because

Love beyond words - Can fill your heart
Love beyond words - You'll feel a part
Love beyond words - You won't be alone anymore

The Abmsus7 chord is the only one I’m not sure about. When I worked it out on Guitar, if you play Abm7, then slide the fingering up 2 frets (one tone), that seems to be the correct chord, but I couldn’t figure out what to call it, even trying it on piano. Playing Abmsus7 is the closest named chord I could find. If you know what that mystery chord is, please let me know!
