All Guitars tuned down one half step

Intro: F Eb (I havent figured out the exact chords yet)

THE PROSTITUTE:
(F)Hey Snow White and the Harlem Knight
You (Eb)make a perfect pair
(F)Skin and bones and a hatchet faced homes
Hey, (Eb)what you doin' 'round here

(Db)Why don't you go back to Central (Bb)Park Or
(Db)stick around and see why love is (Bb)art

(F)In my sin I've sunk right in
I (Eb)finally understood
(F)Why all the geeks and the Catholic Priests
They (Eb)love to do us good

(Db)Maybe you would like some at my (Bb)cost? Or 
(Db)maybe you and the white shadow should go get (Bb)lost

F Eb

(Ab)'Cause I'm sick of (Gb)pity and morphine
(F)I'm sick of you runnin' me down (F Gb G) 
(Ab)I'm sick but (Gb)maybe there's something
(F)That can still save me from the depths of this town

F Eb

One more time I'll speak my mind
And then you'd better go
Before Sad Sam and the backdoor man
Make me wish I'd just said no

(Db)I might come to your meeting in the (Bb)park But
(Db)now I've got to work it's getting dark

F Eb

(Ab)'Cause I'm sick of (Gb)pity and morphine
(F)I'm sick of you runnin' me down (F Gb G) 
(Ab)I'm sick but (Gb)maybe there's something
(F)That can still save me - That can still save me

F Eb


For the Breakdown Part:

The first chord is a Eb chord with a Db in the bass, a 4/2 inversion.   
The second chord is a Db chord. Those two repeat.  
Then it resolves to an Abmaj7 chord....spelled Ab, C, Eb, G

SNOW:
Come you worn out weak and tired
To this meeting in the dark of the night
And you'll walk in the light
Yes, you'll walk in the light

If you're addicted and afflicted
My name is Snow and I've the gift and the sight
And we'll make it alright
Yes, we'll make it alright

F Eb
