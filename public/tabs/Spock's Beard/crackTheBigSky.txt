"Crack the Big Sky" by Spock's Beard

Notes: The chords to this song are EXTREMELY complicated, and so is the song
structure(which is the main thing that slowed me down)... anyways, I don't
think this is extremely accurate, sorry, but it's rather hard. I've only
played keyboard for 8 years on and off... (I'm 15 right now)

 We played the liberation game,

 they gave a war, someone came.

 We dropped the torch - easy,

           Absus4                      Eb
 now let's all go out and dance in the rain.

 Eb                          C#sus4
 Anything could happen then,

 Let's make stuff we can't live without.

 Eb
 We'll make up your meaning,

       Absus4
 let's get you right in,

 you can't be left out.

 Night stayed, and music played,

 we could not shame this high.

 Absus4        Ebm              F#
 After we came down, we hit the ground,

               Ebm7
 crack the big sky.

 N.C.
 but you can't find a phone.
