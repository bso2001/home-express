[Intro]

A5                        D2                       Fmaj7               G    A
You declared you would be three inches taller, You only became what we made
you.
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling, You only earned what we gave you.

D                         G/D                   D7                   G/D
You fell and cried as our people were starving, now you know that we blame
you.

A5                       D2                     F                    G      A
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving, now you know that we framed
you.

[chorus]
D                  G/D                      Cadd9
I'm the guy in the sky flying high flashing eyes
                   G                        E      
No surprise I told lies I'm the punk in the gutter

                 Esus4                 D2/B
I'm the new president but I grew and I bent

                         A                           E
Don't you know? don't it show? I'm the punk with the stutter.

    D  D2 D  D2        
    My my my my    my mmmm my my my.  GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation.

We tried to speak between lines of oration
You could only repeat what we told you.
Your axe belongs to a dying nation,
They don't know that we own you.
You're watching movies trying to find the feelers,
You only see what we show you.
We're the slaves of the phony leaders
Breathe the air we have blown you.

[repeat chorus]

D                           G/C                                G/B
I have to be careful not to preach, I can't pretend that I can teach,

                               A
And yet I've lived your future out by pounding stages like a clown.


And on the dance floor broken glass, the bloody faces slowly pass,
The numbered seats in empty rows, it all belongs to me, you know.

[repeat first verse]
