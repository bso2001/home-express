      OH let the sun beat down upon my face, stars fill my dream
      I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been
      secret elders of a gentle race, swierl but seldom seen
      top of days for which they sit and wait, all will be revealed

      offer song from tongues of lilding grace, sounds caress my ear
      not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear
      WHOOA  OH,  WHOOA OH

      Am                     B     Am                  B
      and my eye filled with sand, as I scan this racy land

      try'n to find, try'n to find were I've been

 (basic song riff)
      AHHHH

      OH I love the storm that leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dream
      he is the band that led me to that place, yellow desert screams
      like shangrela beneath the summer moon, I will return to err
      as the death that floats behind you, were moving through kashmir

 (basic song riff)
      OH father of the four winds fill my sails, cross the sea of errs
      with no provisions but an open face, norm'd straits of fear
