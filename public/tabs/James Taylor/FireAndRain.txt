Fire and Rain                       James Taylor
C              Gm7                    F              C
Just yesterday morning the let me know you were gone
          G                      Bb
Susan the plans they made put an end to you
C                 Gm7           F               C
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song I just cant
  G             Bb
remember who to send it to
 
F        Dm7      G11      C           F                  Dm7  G11
Ive seen fire and ive seen rain I seen sunny days that I thought would
      C         F               Dm7       G11            C
never end I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But i
Bb     F(A Bass)       G7      Gm7    C7    | 1 C9    | 2&3 C7
always thought that id see you again
 
 
Wont you look down upon me Jesus you got to help me make a stand
You just got to see through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
An' I wont make it any other way
(chorus)
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows itll turn you head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
(chorus)
