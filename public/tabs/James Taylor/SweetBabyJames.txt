								   1970

		G F# E A+ A

		 D               A         G            F#m
		There is a young cowboy he lives on the range.
		    Bm             G             D      F#m
		His horse and his cattle are his only companion.
		   Bm            G            D             F#m
		He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyon.
		G           D           A           Em             A
		Waiting for summer, his pastures to change.
		    G                    A           D
		And as the moon rises he sits by his fire.
		Bm              G        D          A
		Thinkin' about women and glasses of beer.
		G                       A          D
		Closing his eyes as the doggies retire
		   Bm          G             D
		He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
		   Bm       E             A
		As if maybe someone could hear.

			D             G         A  D
		CHORUS:	Goodnight you moonlight ladies.
			Bm         G           D
			Rock-a-bye sweet baby James.
			Bm              G             D
			Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose.
			          Bm        E          A+     A
			Won't you let me go down in my dreams.
			    G          A           D
			And rock-a-bye sweet baby James.

		        D          A          G            F#m
		Now the first of December was covered with snow.
		    Bm         G             D             F#m
		And so was the turnpike from Stockridge to Boston.
		         Bm                G            D               F#m
		Lord the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting.
		     G           D           A            Em      A
		With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go.
		          G              A              D
		There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway.
		  Bm             G              D            A
		A song that they sing when they take to the sea.
		  G              A             D
		A song that they sing of their home in the sky.
		      Bm         G             D
		Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep.
		    Bm            E             A+    A
		But singing works just fine for me.

		CHORUS
