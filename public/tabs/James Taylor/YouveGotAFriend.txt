                       You've Got A Friend
                                                       -c.king 1971

When you're down and troubled and you need a helping hand,
    Am7          D7sus4                G     Gsus4   G
and nothing, oh, nothing is going right,
F#m7                    B7          Em        B7         Em7
close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
   Am7         Bm7                    D7sus4 /D7
to brighten up even your darkest night.

             G          Gmaj7       Cmaj7             Am7 
You just call out my name,  and you know wherever I am,
D7sus4       Gmaj7                 D7sus4
I'll come running to see you again.
G                          Gmaj7  Cmaj7                   Em7     
             
Winter, spring, summer, or fall,  all you got to do is call
         Cmaj7    Bm7              Am7  D7sus4
and I'll be there,     yeah, yeah, yeah.  (2nd time -->*)
D7sus4             G/C Cd/Gsus4 G/F#m7 
You've got a friend.

B7        Em    B7               Em       B7            Em7 
If the sky above you should turn dark and full of clouds,
         Am7       D7sus4                   G  Gsus4  G
and that old north wind should begin to blow,
F#m7                 B7     Em          B7       Em7
keep your head together and call my name out loud.
Am7          Bm7                    D7sus4
Soon I'll be knocking upon your door.  ------>(**)

Hey ain't it good to know that you've got a friend when 
G           Gsus4    Gmaj7         C                  F7
people can be so cold.     They'll hurt you and desert you.
              Em7                       A7
Well, they'll take your soul if you let them.
                  D7sus4         D13
Oh yeah, but don't you let them.

             G          Gmaj7       Cmaj7             Am7 
You just call out my name,  and you know wherever I am,
D7sus4       Gmaj7                 D7sus4
I'll come running to see you again.

Winter, spring, summer, or fall,  all you got to do is call
         C         Gb  Am7   D7sus4
and I'll be there, yes I will.
                  G  C             G
You've got a friend.  You've got a friend.
C                            G
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
              C                           G
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
         C                           Gsus4  G
Oh, yeah, yeah.  You've got a friend.
