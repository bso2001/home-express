WRAPPED AROUND YOUR FINGER
The Police
 
Am             G/A  Em7     Am          Em7
You consider me the young apprentice
Am                    G/A Esus    Am       Em7
Caught between the scylla and charibdes
              G/A   Em7      Am            Em7
Hynotized by you if I should linger
Am                G/A  Esus     Am         Em7
Staring at the ring around your finger
 
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turn into a shining band of gold
 
CHORUS
G                           Fmaj7
I'll be wrapped around your finger
G                           Fmaj7     Em    Dm7    Am     Em7     Am
I'll be wrapped around your finger
 
Mephistopheles is not your name
I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition
 
CHORUS
 
Am               Em7               Fmaj7
Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Dm9               Em7               Fmaj7
Vanish in the air you'll never find me
Am                  Em7        Fmaj7
I will turn your face to alabaster
Dm9                      Em7             Fmaj7
Then you'll find your servant is your master
 
CHORUS
You'll be wrapped around my finger
 
G/A x00003
Esus xx2200
Dm9 xx3210
 
 
Peace, love, and soul,
Paul Zimmerman
