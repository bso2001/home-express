Are the dreams all made solid, are the dreams made real

Were once just a dream in somebody's head

She pictures the broken glass, pictures the steam

[verse]
Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey
Nowhere in the suburbs, in the cold light of day
There in the midst of it so alive and alone
Words support like bone
A                  B

Dreaming of Mer--cy Street, wear your inside  out

Dreaming of mercy     in your daddy's arms again
            E     A B         Dbm          B

Dreaming of Mer--cy Street, swear they moved that  sign
            E/Db A  B       Dbm              Abm/B A9

[verse]
Pulling out the papers from the drawers that slide smooth
Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
To the priest-he's the doctor, he can handle the shocks
Dreaming of the tenderness-the tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips
   A              B                  

[chorus] 
Dreaming of Mercy Street, wear your inside out
Dreaming of mercy in your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street, swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy in your daddy's arms

Mercy, mercy looking for mercy
Dbm      

Mercy,    looking for mercy
Dbm    B              Db     B

Looking for mercy 
            Dbm    A

Looking for mercy...
            Dbm

End:
----
Anne with her father is out in the boat
Dbm                     E/Db

Riding the water, 
Gbm/A                 

Riding the waves
Gbm

On the sea
       Dbm
