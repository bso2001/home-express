Dm                  F/C            C    Csus4/C/Csus2/C
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun

    G7/D                            *F/C      C    C/Csus4/C/Csus2/C
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense

   G7/D                           *F/C  C     C/Csus4/C/Csus2/C
Take what you have gathered from coincidence

The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too is folding over you
And It's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home
The lover who's just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Harmonica break

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Harmonica break

   CADGBE  = 000000

C=032010
Csus4=033010
Csus2=030010  hammer back to C

G7/D=220001 or use G7/B X20001 or G/D, G/B etc.
F/C=X33211 or use 033211
E/B=X22100
Dm=xx0231 or even better use 2x0231 (get that thumb working)

X=string not played

It's been awhile since I've seen Don't Look Back but I think this is where
I first got the idea of using drop C, since Dylan looks like he starts
with a C chord, which I'd always used, but I had never got that low bass
note before.  I'm interested in reviewing the exchange with Donovan,
as described by someone in an earlier post, so I'll have to rent it
again (and order a copy at the same time).

Also the Biograph version is from Manchester '66 a.k.a. the infamous
Royal Albert Hall boot (no?), and is followed on the boot by Desolation
Row if I remember right.  On Biograph you can hear Dylan tuning the
low E string back up at the end of Baby Blue.  If you continue on the
RAH tape you hear him tune the E string up and then play D-Row in
dropped D.

Lastly, that C octave between the 6th and 5th strings that you get in
dropped C is pretty distinctive, sounds different than the fifth (D to A)
you get between the 6th and 5th strings in dropped D.

That's my theory, anyway.  BTW, the expressions of appreciation for the
tunings post are much appreciated.  Thanks to all.
