I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine
Words and Music by Bob Dylan

[Actually in F ... tune down a step?]

Intro:  G   C


  G                            C
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine alive as you or me,

G                                     A7         C
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery.

       G                              C
With a blanket underneath his arm and coat of solid gold,

G         D/F#    Em               C               G
Searching for the very souls whom already had been sold.


(2 additional verses)

Arise, arise, he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Come out, you gifted kings and queens and hear my sad complaint.
No martyr is among you now whom you can call your own
Go on you way acordingly, but you know you're not alone.


I dreamed I saw St. Augustine alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Oh, I awoke in anger so alone and terrified.
I put my fingers to the glass and bowed my head and cried.
