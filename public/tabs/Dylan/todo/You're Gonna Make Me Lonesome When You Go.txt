E5                Emaj7           
I've seen love go by my door, 
     Esus4               
it's never been this close before
E5                       Esus2/A     
Never been so easy or so slow
          E5              Emaj7                           
I've been shooting in the dark too long, 
     Esus2/A                
when something's not right, it's wrong
E5                   Esus2/A           E   
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Dragon clouds so high above, 
I've only known careless love
It always has hit me from below
But this time 'round it's more correct, 
right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover, Queen Anne Lace, 
crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry if you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of, 
you might be spoiling me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Esus2/A                          E
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Esus2/A                            E      
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
F#7                      
Blue river running slow and lazy
A                              Esus2/A
I could stay with you forever, and never realize the time

Situations have ended sad, 
relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine and Rimbaud
But there's no way I can compare 
all those scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to

I look for you in old Honolulu, 
San Francisco, Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
But I'll see you in the sky above, 
in the tall grass and the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
