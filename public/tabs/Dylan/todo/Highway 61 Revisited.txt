A7
Oh God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"
Abe say "Man you must be puttin' me on"
God said, "No", Abe say, "What"
God say, "You can do what you want abe but the
D7                                        A7
Next time you see me comin', you better run
     E7
Well Abe said, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
A7
God said, "Out on Highway 61"

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked Poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "there's only one place I know"
Sam said, "Tell me quick man, I got to run"
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun 
And said, "That way, down Highway 61"

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King,
"I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son"
And he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61"

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told her first father that things weren't right
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white"
He said, "Come here and step into the light"
He says, "Hmm, you're right, 
Let me tell the second mother this is being done"
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now the roving gambler was very bored
Trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
and have it on Highway 61"
