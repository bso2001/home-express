If you see her say hello, she might be in Tangiers
                   G     D                         C   G/B A
She left here last early spring, is living there I hear
Bm              G     D                             G
Say for me that I'm alright, tho things get kind of slow
          Bm                 A
She might think that I've forgotten her,
      G                 D
Don't tell her it isn't so


We had a falling out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And tho' our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
I always have respected her, for doin' what she did and gettin free
Whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Tho' the bitter taste still lingers on
>From the night I tried to make her stay

I see a lot of people, as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Maybe I'm too sensitive, or else I'm gettin soft

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, it all went by so fast
If she's goin' by this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time
