Does anybody have the chords for "Love in Vain"?


The Mighty Quinn - Bob Dylan

G                 D            G
Come all without, come all within
                D               C      G
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
G                 D            G
Come all without, come all within
                D               C      G
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

G           C        G         C
Ev'rybody's building ships and boats
G                 C           G                  C
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes.
G           C            G             C
Ev'rybody's in despair, ev'ry girl and boy
         G                D
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
      C                    G
Ev'rybody's gonna jump for joy.
Come all without...

  G               C                G             C
I like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
    G                  C                  G               C
But jumping queues and making haste, just ain't my cup of meat.
G           C                          G            C
Ev'ryone's beneath the trees, feeding pigeons on a limb
         G                D
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
        C                    G
All the pigeons gonna run to him.
Come all without...

G                C           G              C
Let me do what I wanna do, I can recite 'em all
      G               C              G               C
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
G           C                    G                    C
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on ev'ryones toes.
         G                D
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
      C                 G
Ev'rybody's gonna wanna doze.

Why did the crowd go "Booo!" for Sinnead? Anyway I love this crowd... :-)
