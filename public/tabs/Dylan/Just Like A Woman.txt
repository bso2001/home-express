Just Like A WomanJust Like A Woman

C      F     G   C
Nobody feels any pain

             F     G          C
Tonight as I stand inside the rain

F         G
Everybody knows

F                   G
That Baby's got new clothes

    F   Em Dm C       G
But lately I  see her ribbons and her bows

     Am     C    F   G  
Have fallen from her curls



    C     Em   Dm   C F
She takes just like a woman yes she does

    C          Em   Dm   C F 
She makes love just like a woman yes she does

        C     Em   Dm   C F
And she aches just like a woman

        G                         C    
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
Noboby has to guess
That baby can't be blessed,
'Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest.
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls


Bridge

       E7
It was raining from the first


And I was dying of thirst

     C
So I came in here

         E7
And your long time curse hurts

                        F
But whats worse is this pain in here

G         
I can't stay in here, ain't it clear that.. 

I just can't fit.
Yes I believe it's time for us to quit.
And when we meet again,
Introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when,
I was hungry, and it was your world.
