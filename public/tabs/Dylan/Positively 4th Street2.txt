You got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
F#         C#   B        D#m         C#  
When I was down you just stood there grinning
F#        G#m          B                                F#         
You got a lot of nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend
F#       C#         B      D#m         C#  
You just want to be on the side that's winning

You say I let you down, you know its not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it?
You say you've lost your faith but that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason that you talk behind my back 
I used to be among the crowd you're in with 
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what it don't know to begin with?

You see me on the street you always act surprised
You say how are you? good luck! but you don't mean it
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?

No I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
And now I know you're dissatisfied with your position and you place 
Don't you understand it's not my problem?

I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
and just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
