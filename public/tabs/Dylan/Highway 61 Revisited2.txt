Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked Poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know"
Sam said, "Tell me quick man, I got to run"
Howard just pointed over with his gun
"That way down highway 61"

Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
"I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.

He said, "yeah, I think it can be easily done
Pack it on down to highway 61"

Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light
Yeah, you're right, let me tell your mother this has been done"
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on highway 61

Roving Gambler was very bored
Tried to create a next world war
He found a promoter, nearly fell od the floor
"Though I've never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yeah, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Have it on highway 61"
