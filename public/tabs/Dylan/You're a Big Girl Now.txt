You're A Big Girl Now
Words and Music by Bob Dylan
 
Bm               Am7
Our Conversation was short and sweet
Bm                   Am7
You nearly swept me, off of my feet
        G    
And I'm back in the rain
C                        G   Bm7 C
Ohhh, and you are on dry land
                      Am7  Bm7
You made it there somehow
         Am7      G   D
You're a big girl now
 
 
Bird on the horizon sittin' on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oooh singin' just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singin' through these tears
 
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh but what a shame that all we've shared can't last
I can change I swear, woooa see what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too
 
Love is so simple to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oooh in somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way
 
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream
I'm going out of my mind, oooh with a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart
