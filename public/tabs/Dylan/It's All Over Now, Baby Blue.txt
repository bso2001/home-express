
It's All Over Now, Baby Blue

[Actually in E ... capo 2nd fret]

Intro:  D

    A                                     D
You must leave now take what you need you think will last

        A                                D
But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast

Em                 G               D
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun

Em            G           D
Crying like a fire in the sun.

F#m                            A
Look out the Saints are comin' through

    Em            G         D
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.



The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence

The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too is folding over you
And It's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home
The lover who's just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Harmonica break

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Harmonica break
