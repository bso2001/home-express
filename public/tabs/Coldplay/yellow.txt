G#m              F#               E
Your skin, oh yeh your and bones

turn in to something beautiful
G#m          F#           E

oh what a thing to do, cos it was all yellow

Chorus

Your skin, oh yeh your skin and bones
turn into something beautiful
you know, for you i'd bleed myself dry
for you i'd bleed myself dry
