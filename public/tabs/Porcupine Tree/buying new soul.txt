       G      F/G      G/D 
Dried    up   a        guitar    upon my knee

F/D         F/C                F/G           G/D
should have sold out when the devil came for me

F/D            F/C       F/G            G/D     Bb
Dig        a   hole and throw it out to sea     break

                      C
the code how happy I would be

Bb       C               Dm             F    Gm
I       still wave at the dots on the shore      I

  C            Dm               F    Gm     C
still beat my head against the door    I  still rage

     Dm            F   Gm                      C
and wage my little war    I'm a shade and easy to ignore
