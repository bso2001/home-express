   "You'd better hurry cause it's going fast..."



Lyrics:


If you want it, here it is come and get it, ummm ... make your mind up fast 
If you want it, anytime I can give it, But you better hurry cause it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch 
Will you walk away from a fool and his money

If you want it, here it is come and get it, But you better hurry cause it's going fast
If you want it, here it is come and get it, ummm ... make your mind up fast 
If you want it, anytime I can give it, But you better hurry cause it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch 
Will you walk away from a fool and his money

Sony, if you want it, here it is come and get it 
but you better hurry cause it's going fast 
you'ld better hurry cause it's going, fast ........ 
ohh ..... fool and his money

Sony, if you want it, here it is come and get it 
but you better hurry cause it's going fast 
you'ld better hurry cause it's going fast 
you'ld better hurry cause it's going, fast .........
