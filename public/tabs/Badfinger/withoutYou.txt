  In honor of the reissue of "No Dice" on CD:


                                        Without You

                 E
          Well I can't forget this evening
                  C#m
          Or your face as you were leaving
                A                                   G#
          But I guess that's just the way the story goes
                     C#m                Cm7               A
          You always smile, but in your heart your sorrow shows
                 E      B
          Yes it shows


          Well, I can't forget tomorrow
          When I think of all my sorrow
          I had you there, but then I let you go
          And now it's only fair that I should let you know
          What you should know

                  E
          I can't live
             C#m
          If livin' is without you
                  A
          I can't give
                  B
          I can't give any more
                  E
          I can't live
             C#m
          If livin' is without you
                  A
          I can't give
                  B
          I can't give any more
