[Dm]                           [Am]

[A# F G C (held)]


Angie you're beautiful but ain't it time we said goodbye
Angie I still love you remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear Angie, Angie where will it lead us from here
Angie, where will it lead us from here.

_Instrumental_
Oh Angie don't you weep all your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes but
Angie, Angie ain't it time we said goodbye

_Instrumental_
With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie, I still love you baby.
