The Rolling Stones rendering of this oldie is entirely different. Keith wanted 
to do this after having got hold of other RJ recordings which he hadn't heard
previously, but wanted to add something of the Stones to it. Personally, I think
this version stands on it own (IMHO).

It was recorded in G on 'Get you Ya-Ya's out in 12/8 measure. The chords are:

[intro]
| G 		| Em 	C	| G 	G7	| D		|
[verse]
| G 		| G		| G7		| G7		|
| C 		| D7		| G 	D7	| Gsus4	G 	|
| D7 	D/F# 	| Em 	C 	| G 	G7	| D		|
