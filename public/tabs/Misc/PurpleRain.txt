      PURPLE RAIN  -   Prince
   ----------------------------------


Well the way I play it, I base it on these four chords

 (and to me it sounds pretty much spot on, although maybe the squiggle himself
uses a different tuning to make a few of the shapes easier)


 EADGBE      EADGBE      EADGBE     EADGBE
 X07600      244200      024100     XX0975

  Aadd2      F#m7addB     Eadd9      Dadd2


OK I know you're not gonna like that last D chord, but if you practise a little
you can get it.

Nearly the whole song revolves around these chords, although obviously you can
play around with some slightly different voicings to keep it interesting

(Play a normal A,F#m7 once in a while)

The only different bit goes :

 E           E7sus4                              E          A
Only want to see  you  crying   in   that   purple        rain

 EADGBE

 E7sus4


Hope that helps
