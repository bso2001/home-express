C9 X32033  C/G 332010  F 133211  G 320033 
	
This version is really easy to play! It sounds fine on an acoustic guitar
but it may be boring if you don't play it with a 'smart' rythm and some
hammer-on from time to time.

Verse: 
-----	
	
	G
	I'm broke but I'm happy, I'm sore but I'm kind
	I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
	I'm high but I'm grounded, I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
	I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby

Chorus:
------
                      F
	And what it all comes down to
   C                                  G
	Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine
                      F
	Cause I got one hand in my pocket
          C             C9                      G
	And the other one is givin' a high five

Verse:
-----
	I feel drunk but I'm sober, I'm young and I'm underpaid
	I'm dyin' but I'm workin', yeah
	I care but I'm restless, I'm here but I'm really gone
	I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby

Chorus:
------
	And what it all comes down to
	Is that ev'rything's gonna be quite alright
	Cause I got one hand in my pocket
	And the other one is flickin' a cigarette

(Instrumental part: play G (There it gets really boring. Ask one of
your friends to play the harmonica (Springsteen,Dylan or better, Alanis 
herself) or jump to the next chorus!)

	And what it all comes down to
	Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
	Cause I got one hand in my pocket
	And the other one is givin' a peace sign

Verse:
-----
	I'm free but I'm focused, I'm green but I'm wise
	I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
	I'm sad but I'm laughin', I'm brave but I'm chickenshit
	I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby

Chorus:
------
	And what it all boils down to
	Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
	Well I got one hand in my pocket
	And the other one is playin' a piano

	And what it all comes down to, my friend, yeah
	Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
	Cause I got one hand in my pocket
	And the other one is hailing a taxi cab
