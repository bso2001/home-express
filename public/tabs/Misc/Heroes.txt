Here are the chords per somebody's request.  No time (or interest)
in tabbing. My acoustic doesn't do that Fripp sustain-thing.


"Heroes"  from the album "Heroes" by David Bowie

Intro:  D          G



D                  G
I,       I will be king

        D             G
And you, you will be queen

       C                       D
Though nothing will drive them away

       C                      D
We can beat them just for one day

          C         G                D
We can be Heroes        just for one day

D                  G

And you, you can be mean

     D                  G
And I, I'll drink all the time

             D                     G
'Cause we're lovers and that is a fact

          D                    G
Yes we're lovers and that is that

       C                      D
Though nothing will keep us together

               C                 D
We could steal time just for one day

          C     G             D
We can be Heroes for ever and ever

What do you say?


D                  G
I, I wish you could swim

         D                           G
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

       C                        D
Though nothing will keep us together

       C                      D
We can beat them for ever and ever

             C     G             D
Oh we can be Heroes just for one day

REPEAT 1st verse (sing an octave higher, sound desperate)


D           G
I, I can remember 

D              G
Standing by the wall

         D                  G
And the guards shot above our heads

        D                             G
And we kissed as though nothing could fall

       C                      D
And the Seine was on the other side

          C                       D
Oh we can beat them forever and ever

               C      G                D
Then we can be Heroes just for one day

 David Bowie, Heroes

 Since this is one of my all time favorit songs, I just thought I'd 
 send in the way I play it.

  Intro: D G D G
     D             G
     I wish I could swim        
              D                           G
     Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

            Am                     D
     Though nothing will keep us together

            Am        Em           D
     We can beat them for ever and ever
  
                  Am    Em            D
     Oh we can be Heroes just for one day

    And so on.....
