The Saga Begins  (Al Yankovic)


  G     D/F# Em
A long, long time ago
Am          C
In a galaxy far away
  Em            D
Naboo was under an attack
    G         D/F#   Em
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
      Am            C
Could talk the federation into
Em            C             D
Maybe cutting them a little slack
    Em                 Am
But their response, it didn't thrill us
Em                        Am
They locked the doors and tried to kill us
C     G         Am
We escaped from that gas
     C               D
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass
   G      D/F#  Em
We took a bongo from the scene
       Am               C
And we went to Theed to see the Queen
   G         D/F#  Em
We all wound up on Tatooine
       C        D7
That's where we found this boy...

   G  C            G      D
Oh my my this here Anakin guy
       G             C                G            D
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
       G        C                   G         D
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
       Em                      A7
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
Em                      D7
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"

G                 Am
Did you know this junkyard slave
      C        Am
Isn't even old enough to shave
Em                 D
And he can use the Force, they say
        G           D/F#    Em
Ahh, do you see him hitting on the queen
       Am                 C
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen
Em                       A7        D
Yah, he's probably gonna marry her someday
        Em              D
Well, I knew he built C-3PO
         Em                 D
And I've heard how fast his pod can go
    C       G           A7
And we were broke, it's true
      C               D7
So we made a wager or two
         G     D/F#   Em
He was a prepubescent flyin' ace
        Am                   C
And the minute Jabba started off that race
      G      D/F#      Em
Well, I knew who would win first place
   C       D7      G  C  G  D7
Oh yes, it was our boy


We started singin' ...
My my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
       G              Am
Now we finally got to Coruscant
    C               Am
The Jedi Council we knew would want
   Em               D
To see how good the boy could be
       G       D/D#         Em
So we took him there and we told the tale
        Am                  C
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale
       Em       A7              D
And he might fulfill that prophecy
        Em            D
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course
      Em               D
Could he bring balance to the Force?
     C    G        A7
They interview the kid
    C                D7
Oh, training they forbid
        G    D/F#      Em
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear
    Am                C
And Qui-Gon said "Now listen here"
      G        D/F#    Em
"Just stick it in your pointy ear"
   C          D7         G  C  G  D7
"I still will teach this boy"

He was singin' ...
My my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"

   G        D/F#      Em
We caught a ride back to Naboo
       Am            C
'Cause Queen Amidala wanted to
   Em              D
I frankly would've liked to stay
G      D/F#           Em
We all fought in that epic war
       Am             C
And it wasn't long at all before
       Em               C                   D
Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day
    Em              Am
And in the end some Gunguns died
     Em                     Am
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried
C        G/B        Am
A lot of folks were croakin'
    C                  D
The battle droids were broken
        G   D/F#  Em
And the Jedi I admire most
    C                      D7
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast
      G         D/F#     Em
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost
  C          D7         G
I guess I'll train this boy

And I was singin' ...
My my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"

We were singin' ...
My my this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
        C              D7      G      C    G
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
