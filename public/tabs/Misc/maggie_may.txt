This is my first post to the guitar newsgroup. So please be kind. These are 
what I think are the chords to Maggie May. Corrections welcomed. By the way
can anyone tab the main riff in this song.

Enjoy:



SONG:  MAGGIE MAY

D                  C                         G
Wake up, Maggie, I think I got some-thing to say to you:
     D                    C                G
It's late September and I really should be back at school.
  C                       G        C              D
I know I keep you amused,    but I feel I'm being used.
    Am                      Bm          Am7
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
    Am                      D               Am
You lured me away from home,    just to save you from being alone.
D        Am                D                       
    You stole my heart and that's what really hurts.
G       D                      C                   G
    The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age.
    D                     C                     G
But that don't worry me none; in my eyes you're everything.
     C                    G         C
I laughed at all of your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax,
D       Am                     Bm          
    Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more.
     Am                     D           Am
You lured me away from home,    just to save you from being alone.
D       Am                     D          
      You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without.
G     D                C                G
      All I need was a friend to lend a guiding hand.  
        D                       G                        G
But you turned into a lover and Mother what a lover your wore me out.
        C                 G              C
All you did was wreck my bed, and in the morning kick me in the head,
D          Am                     Bm         Am
       Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more. 
Bm          Am                      D 
       You lured me away from home,     'cause you did'nt want to be alone.
D           Am                       D                    
       You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried.
G      D                      c                   G
       I suppose I could collect my books and get back to school.
    D                       C                    G
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool.
    C                             G       C
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand,
D        Am                 Bm               Am
     Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
                                    D
You made a first class fool out of me, 
           Am                      D
but I'm as blind as a fool can be.
    Am                     D       C7
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.
G              Am                 C
Maggie, I wish I never seen your face.
G                        Am                C
        I'll get on back home one of these days.
