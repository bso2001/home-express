GIMME 3 STEPS                
(Lynyrd Skynyrd)

    D                        D
I was cuttin the rug down at a place called 'The Jug'
     A                A
with a girl named Linda Lou
   D                      D
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
     E                    A
he was looking for you know who.
       D                         D
He said "Hey there fellow with the hair coloured yellow,
G                    E
  watcha tryin' to proove?
			  D                 D
Cuz' thatsa' my woman there and I'm a man who cares
       A                D
and this might be all for you"    (I said "excuse me!")
              
    D                  D
I was scared and fearing for my life
A                        A
shaking like a leaf on a tree
	  D                 D
Cuz' he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord,
E                    A
pointing that gun at me
      D                       D
I said "wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her,
G                               E
  don't want no trouble with you
	 D                           D
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
A                   D
ask one favour from you:
              
	    D                    D
(CHORUS)   Say won't you Gimme 3 steps, gimme 3 steps mister,
    A                  A
gimme 3 steps toward the door?
D                    D
Gimme 3 steps, gimme 3 steps mister
	 A               D
and you'll never see me no more."
(Solo)
	 D                         D
O well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
      A                      A
and the water fell down to the floor
      D                    D
and I'm telling you, son, it ain't no fun,
      E                      A
staring straight down a fourty-four.
       D                      D
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou,
	     G                   E
and that's the break I was looking for
	    D                   D
and you could hear me screaming a mile away
       A                     D
as I was headed out toward the door.
              
(CHORUS)
