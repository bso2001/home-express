Everybody Wants to Rule the World

 
Intro: 4 times |A/D G/D- -| |
        A/D G/D

(Keith suggests tuning the E bass string down to a 'D' to get the bass
rhythm to the song)

(I like to use (xx022x) for A/D and (xx000x) for G/D)

 
                   A/D G/D                     A/D G/D
Welcome to your life,      there's no turning back,
                   A/D G/D
Even while we sleep,        we will find you
Em             F#m
Acting on your best behavior
G                 F#m
Turn your back on mother nature,
Em   F#m   G        A        A/D   G/D     Ab G/D
Everybody wants to rule the world
 
It's my own design, it's my own remorse,
Help me to decide, help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure,
Nothing ever lasts forever,
Em   F#m   G       A        G
Everybody wants to rule the world
 
                         D           A
There's a room where the light won't find you
G                        D         A        G
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
                       D      A
When they do, I'll be right behind you
 
Em            F#m
So glad we've almost made it
G           F#m
So sad they had to fade it
Em   F#m   G       A         D     G|D A|G   |D A|
Everybody wants to rule the world
                                    
Pseudotab Solo:

e-----10-9-7---------------|                           |          |
B--10--------10-7-8-10-----| (repeat 3x) then end with |          |
G----------------------7---|                           |          |
D--------------------------|                           | D--9-7-- |
              
I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Em   F#m   G       A        D     A
Everybody wants to rule the world
 
Instrumental bit: |Bm   |C   |Bm   |C   |G   |A   |A/D G/D| |A/D G/D|  |
 
Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it.
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world.
 
All for freedom and for pleasure,
nothing ever lasts forever,
Everybody wants to rule the world
 
Outro: |A/D G/D  |   | repeat and fade

I was just cruising by this section and I saw this song by Tears which
I've been playing on guitar for a few years.  I checked out the chords
and I'm sure you'll be happy to know that they're a little different
than previously posted (at least the key is right!)

Wherever it is written E minor, the band actually plays Emin9 (a much
richer sounding chord).  Also, the G in those verses are actually
Gmaj7.  Finally, the A which follows the G (actually Gmaj7) is really
an A6, which is not surprising since the opening riff of the song is
a sixth arpeggio over the A.  No need to tune down either, since the
bass string is played open on the Eminor9
