Verse Lyrics
2.
Now for ten years we've been on our own and moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But that's not how it used to be when the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean and a voice that come form you and me
Oh and while the king was looking down the jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx the quartet practised in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

3.
Helter Skelter in the summer swelter the birds flew off with a fallout 
    shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast, it lounded foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass, with the jester on the sidelines 
    in a cast
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume while the Sergeants played a marching
    tune
We all got up to dance but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field, the marching band refused to 
    yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died

4.
And there we were all in one place, a generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire id the devil's only friend
And as I watched him on the stage my hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed higher into the night to light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

5.
I met a girl who sang the blues and I asked her for some happy news
But she just smile and turned away
I went down to the sacred store where I heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets the children screamed the lovers cried and the poets 
    dreamed
But not a word was spoken the church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son and the Hoy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died.

A long, long time ago, I can still remember how that

music used to make me smile.

VERSE:
G                 Am                    C               Am
Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above?
Em              D
If the Bible tells you so.
G            D/F#     Em
Now do you believe in rock and roll
    Am7             C
Can music save your mortal soul and
Em                      A7    D
Can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Em                          D
Well, I know that you're in love with him,
        Em              D
Cause I saw you dancing in the gym, 
    C           G               A7
You both kicked off your shoes, 
      C                    D7
Man I dig those rhythm and blues.
        G      D/F#    Em       
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck with a
Am                    C
Pink carnation and a pick up truck,
    G     D/F#     Em              C       D7       G     C
But I knew I was out of luck the day, the music, died.
G              D7                         D7
    I started singing, Bye - bye..........die

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter.
Eight miles high and fallin' fast,
It landed foul on the grass.
The players tried for a forward pass,
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.
Now that halftime air was sweet perfume,
While the sergeants played a marching tune.
We all got up to dance, but we
Never got the chance

And there we were all in one place,

So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,

Cause fire is the devil's only friend.
And as I watched him on the stage my
Hands were clenched in fists of rage.
No angel born in hell,

This'll be the day that I die________.

END (finally!)


I'm _not_ going back through that to check the spelling, so I hope it's 
okay. If you're a beginner, try playing the D/F# as just a D for now,
but that's the only chord that could possibly be a problem. Other than
that, a pretty easy song! enjoy!

Please note that even when I used your lines, I shuffled some of them around!
I included the chords as I know them... there are three sets... the one for
the first and last verses, the one for the others, and the one for the chorus.
The chords aren't definitive, but the lyrics pretty much are.
I also interspersed the references that I know of, and included some commentary
on the lyric content at the end.  Have fun!

As far as I can get it, this is a fairly conservative song about 
how music used to be great in the fifties, then some interesting stuff
started happening, but musicians got out of line -- preaching morality
(Dylan with the thorny crown)  preaching politics (the Beatles refusing
to yeild the field to the "players" -- who, the politicians?) and 
preaching immorality (the Stones, who he REALLY rags on).  All this 
religous stuff is not just allegorical, I got one of his albums and he's
majorly religous.  I don't know, I went to all the trouble learning this
song then I found out it made a point I didn't agree with --- music shouldn't
have serious content.  As if the sixties started that trend anyway; only
a baby boomer could have written this song!  Still, it's a good song,
and it's fun at parties.

  C                      D
I couldn't take one more step
      G       Bm     Em
And I can't remember if I cried 
       C              D
When I read about his widowed bride
G             Bm         Em
But something touched me deep inside
    C       D     G
The day the music died

CHORUS:
   G    C        G        D
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C            G        D
Drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
     G        C                G           D
Them good ol' boys was drinkin whiskey and rye
            Em                        A
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
Em                        D
This'll be the day that I die.


Did you write the book of love 
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rock and roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And cay you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym.
You both kicked off your shoes.
Well I dig those rhythm and blues.
I was a lonely teenage bronkin' buck
With a pink Carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died.  And I was singin'

CHORUS

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone, but
That's not how it used to be.
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
and a voice that came from you and me.
Oh and while the king was looking down, 
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned.
And while Lennin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died.
And we were singin'

CHORUS

Helter skelter in the summer swelter
The birds flew off the fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergents played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
But we never got the chance.
'Cause the players tried to take the field,
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died.
And we were singin'

Chorus

And in there we were all in one place
A generation Lost in Space 
With no time left to start again.
So come on Jack be nimble
Jack be quick
Jack flash sat on a candlestick because
Fire is the devil's only friend
Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died.
And he was singin'

CHORUS

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news.
She just smiled and turned away.
So I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music once before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets the children screamed.
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed.
but not a word was spoken.
The church bells all were broken.
And the three men I admire the most--
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost--
Well they took the last train for the coast
The day the music died.
And they were singin'

CHORUS (slowly)
CHORUS (build up to full speed)
