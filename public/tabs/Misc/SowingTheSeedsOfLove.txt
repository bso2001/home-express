TEARS FOR FEARS:  "SOWING THE SEEDS OF LOVE"
(Roland Orzabal / Curt Smith)


Verse One:    
-----------------
Gm7             F
High time we made a stand
       EbMaj7                          Am/D
And shook up the views of the common man
                 EbMaj7              Am/D
And the love train, rides from coast to coast
EbMaj7              Am/D   
DJ's the man we love the most

Gm7                                 F
Could you be could you be squeaky clean
       EbMaj7                       Am7 
And smash every hope of democracy
                 EbMaj7                         Am/D
As the headline says you're free to choose
           EbMaj7                      Am/D     
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
EbMaj7                                    Am/D
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues


Chorus:
-----------
C             CMaj7              Am
Sowing the seeds of love
AmMaj7          FMaj7
Seeds of love
Ab             G7
Sowing the seeds

(Repeat)

Verse two (same chords as verse one):
---------------------------------------------------------
I spy, tears in their eyes
They look to the skies for some kind of divine
intervention, food goes to waste
So nice to eat, so nice to taste

Politician granny with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the majority feels
So without love and a promised land
We're fools to the rules of the government plan
Kick out the style, bring back the jam

(Chorus)


Instrumental:
-------------------
Fmaj7     EbMaj7
Fmaj7     EbMaj7
F            EbMaj7
F            EbMaj7

F            Eb   Bb
F            Eb   Bb
F            Eb   Bb
F            Eb   Bb


Verse Three:
------------------

FMaj7            EbMaj7 
Feel the pain, talk about it
               FMaj7                  EbMaj7 
If you're a worried man, then shout about it
FMaj7           EbMaj7  
Open hearts, feel about it
FMaj7           EbMaj7
Open minds, think about it
FMaj7       EbMaj7 
Everyone, read about it
FMaj7       EbMaj7 
Everyone, scream about it
FMaj7        EbMaj7
Everyone,  everyone
FMaj7       EbMaj7
Everyone, read about it
Eb                                     D7
Read it in the books, in the crannies and the nooks there are books to read

(Chorus -- omit words)

Gm7                      F 
Time to eat all your words
                    EbMaj7              Am/D
Swallow your pride, Open your eyes
Gm7                      F
Time to eat all your words
                    EbMaj7              Am/D
Swallow your pride, Open your eyes
Gm7             F
High time we made a stand 
       EbMaj7                           Am/D 
And shook up the views of the common man
                  EbMaj7              Am/D
And the love train, rides from coast to coast
EbMaj7               Am/D
Every minute of every hour
EbMaj7      Am/D   
I love a sunflower
EbMaj7       Am/D   EbMaj7 Am/D   EbMaj7  Am/D    EbMaj7  Am/D
And I believe           in love    power, love         power, love
             power

(Chorus)


Ending:
-----------

Ab             G7 
Sowing the seeds
      Ab     G7   
An end to need
            Ab           G7
And the politics of greed


Enjoy,
    M. Triana
