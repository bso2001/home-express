 Horse with no name

( Yes, the entire song is played in the second fret ! )

I like to strike the base note on a downstroke on the first beat
followed by the bottom four strings. Alternating up and down
on Em and Em9, up only on D6/9 and Dmaj9


       Em                D6/9
On the first part of the journey
I was lookin at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There were sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
and the sky with no clouds
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
but the air was full of sound

Chorus
 Em9                              Dmaj9

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
la la la  la lalala   la la  la  la la


After two days in the desert sun
my skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
made me sad to think it was dead

chorus


After nine days I let the horse run free
'cause the desert had turned to sea
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there were sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
and the perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
but the humans will give no love

"Horse With No Name" - Another Version

This is the tab as I have figured it out for "Horse With No Name" by
america.  IMHO, this is closer to what is on the album "America's
greatest Hits"

It consists of two chords:

E ----
A -7--
D -9--
G ----  and...
B ----
E ----

E -7--
A -5--
D -7--
G -7--
B ----
E ----

And the tab for the stumming pattern looks something like this... play
along with the disc and you will get the gist :)

E 0-0000007777-7
A x-7777775555-x
D x-9999997777-x
G x-0000007777-x
B x-0000000000-x
E x-0000000000-x

Even though everyone else usually uses 4 chords and tries to do the
changes with the vocal line, if you listen to the guitar line on
"Greatest Hits", its only two chords.  The first is an E minor
(the 7/9 thing)... the other is something funky... its not exactly
what they play, but its close... Hope you enjoy.
