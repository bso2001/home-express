This is a very basic version.


NOTHING COMPARES 2 U - PRINCE


F                              C
	It's been seven hours and thirteen days

Bb							F	C
	Since you took your love away

F                             C
	I go out every night and sleep all day

Bb							F	C
	Since you took your love away

F                                         C
	Since you've been gone I can do what ever I want

Bb							F	C
	I can see whomever I choose

F                                   C
	I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant, But

Bb                                 G
nothin', I said nothin' can take away these blues, `Cause

Bb          F      Bb               F       C
nothing compares, nothing compares 2 U

F                            C
	It's been so lonely without you here

Bb							F	C
	I'm like a bird without a song

F                                  C
	Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling, Tell me

Bb                    C
baby, where did I go wrong?

F                                     C
	I could put my arms around every girl I see

Bb								F	C
	But they'd only remind me of you

F                                           C
	I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me, He said,

Bb                                        G
Boy you better try to have fun no matter what you do, but he's a fool, `Cause

Bb          F      Bb               F       C
nothing compares, nothing compares 2 U

F                                     C  
	All the flowers that you planted, in the backyard

Bb							F	C
	All died when you went away

F                                         C
	I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard

Bb                                       G
	But I'm willing to give it another try

Bb          F      Bb               F       C
Nothing compares, nothing compares 2 U
