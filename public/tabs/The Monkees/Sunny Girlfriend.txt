She owns and operates 
    F      C          G   D   G
Her own sunshine factory
                       F
Of painting smiles on dolls
    C       G   D  G
And then on me
         C                  D7
She's my sunny girlfriend 
And personality.

Well, she's got a book 
That tells about ev'rybody's past
And she can make you slow 
While making your mind move fast
She's my sunny girlfriend
And she is never last.

F              G
Oh, while I am sleeping
F              G
Then she comes creeping
Em      Am                Em
Into my thoughts at night
                    Am
Gazing down through eyes 
             C            D7
As bright as wonder.

She can send you on your way
To ev'rywhere
She's only started 
After you think that she is there.
Well, she's my sunny girlfriend, 
And she just doesn't care.
Yes, she's my sunny girlfriend, 
She doesn't really care.
