Verse 1:

	 A                    A+ [1,5: A+/C#]
	Reasoned verse, some prose or rhymes
	F#m                Adim
	Lose themselves in other times
	     Bm                 E
	And waiting hopes cast silent spells
	      Bm               E
	That speak in crowded clues
	   Bm           F
	It cannot be a part of me
	    Dm                A
	For now it's part of you

Verse 2:

	Careful plays on fields that seem to
	Vanish when they're in between
	And softly as I walk away
	In freshly tattered shoes
	It cannot be a part of me
	For now it's part of you

Bridge:

	           C#
	[2: Well] Sunshine, ragtime
	 F#m
	Blowing in the breeze
	 B
	Midnight, looks right
	 E7               E+
	Standing more at ease

Verse 3:

	Silhouettes and figures stay
	Close to what we had to say
	And one more time a faded dream
	Is saddened by the news
	It cannot be a part of me
	For now it's part of you
