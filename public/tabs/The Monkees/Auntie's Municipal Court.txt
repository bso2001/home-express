Fine man, crazy man, he can't see.
G                    Gsus4
Sound of the sunset, sound of the sea.
G                        Gsus4
Why do the people always look at me?
G                               C     Csus4
Nobody here can see that we are you,
       C     Csus4
We are you.
           G
She's him, too.
She's him, too.
D
Fine man, crazy man, he can't see.
C
Sound of the sunset, sound of the sea.
G
Ummmm, hummmmmm.
Ummmm, hummmmmm.

Solid brass statuary guards the door
Used to come as one, now it comes as four.
Somebody here just sent for more
Red and yellow cartoons saying we need two
We need two.
More than you.
More than you.
Solid brass statuary guards the door
Used to come as one, now it comes as four.
Ummmm, hummmmmm.
Ummmm, hummmmmm.

Em
Somebody stole their mind.
Somebody stole their mind.
C
They say they can't find
D
What is kind.
        D7
What is kind.

[Instrumental]

Somebody stole their mind.
Somebody stole their mind.
They way they can't find
What is kind.
What is kind.

Fine man, crazy man, he can't see.
Sound of the sunset, sound of the sea.
Why do the people walk away from me?
Nobody can see that we are you,
We are you.
She's him, too.
She's him, too.
Fine man, crazy man, he can't see.
Sound of the sunset, sound of the sea.
Ummmm, hummmmmm.
Ummmm, hummmmmm.
