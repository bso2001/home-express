
The Door Into Summer    


         D           C2              D
With his fool's gold stacked up all around him
                      C2            D
From a killing in the market on the war
    A                  G            D       G
The children left King Midas there, as they found him
       D                    C2                 D
In his counting house where nothing counts but more

CHORUS:
       A                    G          D          
And he thought he heard the echoes of a penny whistle band
        A               G           D
And the laughter from a distant caravan
        A                G             D       G
And the brightly painted line of circus wagons in the sand
D                  C2        G/B     C2    D
Fading through the door into summer

Well, it's travel onto "maybe next year" places
As a trade-in for a name upon the door
And he pays for it years he cannot buy back with his tears
As he finds out there's been no one keeping score

CHORUS 2x
