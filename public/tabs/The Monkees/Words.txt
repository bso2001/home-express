      Notes on Radio Radio:
      On this enthusiastic track from 1978's Live at the El Mocambo, Elvis and 
      his Attractions seem to be in good form. You'll just need to know a few 
      barre chords to play this song well. [MP3/TAB]

                                "Words"

	-----------------

Verse 1:

	(C#m)
	Girl, don't you know everytime I see you smiling
			Hurts so bad 'cause when I see you I start crying
	Try everything to stop but there's no denying
			Falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying

	 D      C#
	Ahh... don't walk away
	 D                B
	How... how can I make you stay
	Don't turn away
	I can still hear you saying those

Chorus:

	 E          A          E
	Words that never were true
	  A        E      A       C#
	Spoken to help nobody but you
	 F#         B      F#
	Words with lies inside
	      B              F#             B            D# 
	But small enough to hide 'til your playing was through

[repeat intro riff, 1X]

Verse 2:

	Girl don't you know we can work it out with talking
			You won't turn around nor slow down your walking
	I've given you everything with a kiss to seal it
			You have to get your kicks out of tryin' to steal it

	Now... I'm standing [2: here]
	Strange... strange voices in my ears
	I feel the tears
	But all I can hear are those

[repeat chorus]

[repeat intro riff, 2X]

Instrumental break:

	Organ solo over intro riff [6X]
	(note descending inner voice in organ chord: C# B A# A G#)

[repeat verse 2 from "Now..."]

[repeat chorus; fade 3rd time]
