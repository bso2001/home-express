Kevin Gilbert: Tea For One Again

Tea For One 
Em9        A/E 
Duncan was always cautious 
C/E                     Em9 
Never the one to take a stand 
                A/E 
Convinced to the bone 
F/E               Esus4 
That he's happier alone 
Dsus4              D 
And to justify the part 
Dsus4                   D 
Keeps a closely guarded heart 

Em9           A/E 
Standing amidst the subway 
C/E  Em9 
He spies the lady of his dreams 
                A/E 
And catches her stare 
     F/E                Esus4 
Long enough to make him care 
Dsus4    D 
"Oh my Lord, if beauty has a name 
Asus4                 A 
Then hers must be the same..." 

B           Bm7#5 
Lights upon empty rooms 
A              Em       G 
Home too soon, home too soon 
B           Bm7#5 
Somewhere inside he burns 
A             Gmaj9       F#m11 
It looks like tea for one again 
           Gmaj9       B7sus4  B7 
Looks like tea for one again, again 

Em9         A/E 
He sees her every day now
C/E                              Em9 
And each day he walks her to her door
         A/E             F/E             Esus4 
But ever polite he still sleeps alone at night
   Dsus4           D 
He keeps desire at bay
Asus4                 A 
Afraid to change his ways

B           Bm7#5 
Lights upon empty rooms 
A              Em       G 
Home too soon, home too soon 
B           Bm7#5 
Somewhere inside he burns 
A             Gmaj9       F#m11 
It looks like tea for one again 
A             Gmaj9       F#m11 
It looks like tea for one again 
           Gmaj9       B7sus4  B7 
Looks like tea for one again, again 


Em9         A/E 
Grey Monday evening finds him
C/E                       Em9 
Making their usual stops alone
                A/E 
Where can she be?
        F/E           Esus4 
He just has to go and see
            Dsus4        D 
And there's roses in his hand
        Dsus4        D 
For his new romantic plans

Em9            A/E 
Caught in the pouring rain
C/E                         Em9 
He crouches beneath her awning
                      A/E 
And there through the screen
             F/E      Esus4 
He spies his lady of esteem
    Dsus4                            D
Not alone and there's rapture on her face
  Asus4          A 
Within a man's embrace

B           Bm7#5 
Lights upon empty rooms 
A              Em       G 
Home too soon, home too soon 
B           Bm7#5 
Somewhere inside he burns 
A             Gmaj9       F#m11 
It looks like tea for one again 
B           Bm7#5 
Lights upon empty rooms 
A              Em       G 
Home too soon, home too soon 
B           Bm7#5 
Somewhere inside he burns 
A             Gmaj9       F#m11 
It looks like tea for one again 
A             Gmaj9       F#m11 
It looks like tea for one again 
A             Gmaj9       F#m11 
It looks like tea for one again 
           Gmaj9       B7sus4  B7 
Gonna be tea for one again
