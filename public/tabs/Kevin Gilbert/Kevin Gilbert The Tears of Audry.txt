Kevin Gilbert: The Tears of Audry

The Tears of Audry 

Intro:
D  A  D  A

D                          A
Audry's donning her black dress again
D                           A
A dress she always plans to wear
       B
"It's over,"
     D1/A1/B1/A1  (1 beat each)
She says it softy
B            D1/A1/E2
Over.  'I'm all alone"

D                           A
She does not listen to the euligies
D                              A
She gives no creedence to her pain
      B              D1/A1/B1/A1
"From now on I'm through with love
B               D1/A1/E2         A    A
"From now on I will not love again"

Full Chorus:
A             D  
There are no hearts to mend
A             D
There are no prayers to send
            A                          
There's no reason why
             B                  D1/A1/B1/A1   B/C#
There's no need to cry for the sadness of it all.
A              D
There are no skies of blue
A              D
There are no dreams come true
          A
And there is no care
          B                      D1/A1/B1/A1   B/C#
Let the world beware should the tears of Audry fall.

D                            A
She carefully polishes her heart of stone
D                            A
She deftly molds her feet of clay
     B           D1/A1/B1/A1
"I'm no one and none can touch me
B                D1/A1/E2         A   A
"No one... it's easier that way.


A             D  
There are no hearts to mend
A             D
There are no prayers to send
      A                          
Is it so unfair?
     B                        D1/A1/B1/A1   B/C#
Let world beware should the tears of Audry fall

F#m2/C#m1/Bm1    A
F#m2/C#m1/Bm     A/C#m
F#m2/C#m1/Bm     A       E      B

D                              A
So now she's shutting all her windows tight
D                              A
And now she's closing all her blinds
      B        D1/A1/B1/A1
"How can I believe in light
      B            D1/A1/E2     A   A   
"When darkness is all around?"

Full Chorus

F#m2/C#m1/Bm1   A
