F               G                   C
We must say goodbye, but there’s no need for you to cry,
     G             F             C
It’s better that I tell you this tonight.
             F                   G
Though our affair has been quite heated,
            Am             D
You thought I was what you needed,
        C                G          F  G       C
But the time has come my darlin’ to set things right.

        C                                G
I’ll be harder than your husband to get along with,
F                G             C
Harder than your husband every night,
        Bb               F        Bb               F
I’ll be harder than your husband, harder than your husband
    Dm               F              C        G
And I don’t want our love affair to end in a fight.

You’ve been like a little angel, how you loved me,
And I appreciate the warmth of your embrace,
Well the world don’t need to know how I adore you,
But the time has come my darlin’ to tell you this face to face.

And so it’s adios, adios, my little darlin’ (adios my little darlin’)
Keep that hanky that I gave you for when you cry,
There are things that trouble me and I’m sure that you must see
That it breaks my heart the same as yours when we say good-bye.

Bb               F        Bb
Harder than your husband, harder than your (much, much, much)
