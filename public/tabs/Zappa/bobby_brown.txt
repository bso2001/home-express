C
Hey there people I'm Bobby Brown

Am
They say I'm the cutest boy in town

Dm7
My car is fast, my teeth are shiney

G
I tell all the girls they can kiss my hiney

Here I am at a famous school
I'm dressing sharp and I'm acting cool
I got a cheerleader here, wants to help with my paper
Let her do all the work and maybe later I'll rape her


      F
   Oh God I am the american dream

     Em               Am
   I do not think I'm too extreme

             Dm7               G
   And I'm a handsome son of a bitch


   I'm gonna get a good job and be real rich


     (get a good, get a good, get a good, get a good job)


Women's liberation
Came creeping all across the nation
I tell you people, I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of Freddy

She made a little speach then
uuh, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice, but she left the dick
I guess it's still hooked on but now it shoots too quick

   Oh God I am the american dream
   But now I smell like vaseline
   I'm a miserable son of a bitch
   Am I a boy or a lady, I don't know which
     ( I wonder, wonder, I wonder, wonder)
  
So I went out and bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but I'm still kinda cute
Got a job doing radio promo
And none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo

Eventually me and a friend
Sort of drifted along into S&M
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
As long as I gets a little golden shower

   Oh God, I am the american dream
   With a spindle up my butt 'till it makes me scream
   And I'll do anything to get ahead
   I lay awake nights saying "Thank you, Fred"


      F                
   Oh God, oh God, I'm so fantastic
   
   Em                       Am
   Thanks to Freddie, I'm a sexual spastic
   
          F             G
   And my name is Bobby Brown
   
   
   Watch me now, I'm going down
   
          F             G
   And my name is Bobby Brown
   
   
   Watch me now, I'm going down
