AND DAGMAR 
Without a doubt, the ugliest sonofabitch 
I ever saw in my life
WHAT HIS NAME
1,2,3,4
THE WHISKERS STICKING OUT FROM UNDERNEATH OF
HIS PANCAKE MAKEUP
And yet he was a beautiful lady
NEARLY DROVE YOU INSANE
Lets talk about leather
AND SO YOU KISSED A LITTLE SAILOR
Tex abel, starring in the latest shepperton production
WHO HAD JUST BLEW IN FROM SPAIN
"Sir Richard Pump-A-Loaf"
YOU SNIFFED THE REEKING BUNS OF ANGEL
The story of a demented bread boffer
AND ACTED LIKE IT WAS COCAINE
Cucumber pud annexed to a fine whole-wheat loaf

YOU WERE DAZZLED BY THE EXCITING NEW COSTUME OF KOKO
then on Tuesday night, Caesar's back in town
IN A WAY YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN
Facing off in a no holds barred tag team grudge match with kona
AND SO YOU WORKED THE WALL WITH MICHAEL
379 pounds of Samoan dynamite
WHICH GAVE YOUR BACK AN AWFUL STAIN
Volcanic hell
BUT YOU CAME BACK ON SUNDAY FOR THE GONG SHOW
next Thursday, teen town finest
F#m   E
BUT YOU FORGOT WHAT I WAY SAYIN
E
'CAUSE YOUR AN ASSHOLE, YOUR AN ASSHOLE
THAT'S RIGHT
E
'CAUSE YOUR AN ASSHOLE, YOUR AN ASSHOLE
YES, YES
E
'CAUSE YOUR AN ASSHOLE, YOUR AN ASSHOLE
THAT'S RIGHT
E
'CAUSE YOUR AN ASSHOLE, YOUR AN ASSHOLE
