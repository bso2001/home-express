Jet! I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told me that
                              D/A   A
You were going to be marrying soon.
    C#m7                 Bm
And Jet, I thought the only
          D6               A
Lonely place was on the moon.

Jet! Jet!

A                                 D/A        A
Jet! Was your father as bold as a sergeant major?
How come he told you that
                           D/A  A
You were hardly old enough yet?
    C#m7                 Bm
And Jet, I thought the major
        D6           A
Was a lady suffragette.

Jet! Jet!

Bm                        E
Ah, matter, want Jet to always love me?
Bm                        E
Ah, matter, want Jet to always love me?
Bm          A
Ah, matter, much later.

A                                    D/A         A
Jet! with the wind in your hair of a thousand laces.
Climb on the back and we'll
                     D/A  A
Go for a ride in the sky.
    Cmaj7                Bm
And Jet, I thought the major
        D6           A
Was a lady suffragette.

Jet! Jet!
