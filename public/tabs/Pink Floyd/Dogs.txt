                          ---------------------------

The other dogs.crd file from Nevada has some mistakes in it 

I think it was just a slip-up when it was typed, but the last two
chords it gives sound horrible.

I think you have to tune all strings down a tone to be in tune 
with the record, so the strings should be tuned to : DGCFAD


The shapes are :

   DGCFAD     DGCFAD     DGCFAD     DGCFAD
   022032     x33010     xx4420     xx3310

    Dm9       Bbadd4     E7sus4    Ebmaj7sus4


These chords fade in slowly over the Dm9

Play 4 bars of each chord :

 Dm9       Bbadd4       E7sus4       Ebmaj7sus4


It repeats over and over........
One extra point : there is a little grace note, or added note on
the last two chords of the sequence (E and Eb)

On the last strum of each bar add a finger on the top D string
- for the E chord, add at the second fret, for the Eb chord add
at the first fret.

I can't TAB out the exact strumming pattern as it's pretty busy
playing, but for these two chords with the extra note it looks
roughly like this :

D--0--0-0---0--0-0---0-2-- .... --0--0-0---0--0-0---0-1---- ....
A--2--2-2---2--2-2---2-2-- .... --1--1-1---1--1-1---1-1---- ....
F--4--4-4---4--4-4---4-4-- .... --3--3-3---3--3-3---3-3---- ....
C--4--4-4---4--4-4---4-4-- .... --3--3-3---3--3-3---3-3---- .... 
G------------------------- .... --------------------------- .... 
D------------------------- .... --------------------------- ....


                     ^^^^                           ^^^^
               note added here                   and here

 I've missed out the three repeated bars in the middle and at the end
What I've tabbed is just one bar's worth of each chord.

Hope you get the idea

Enjoy !

DOGS- Pink Floyd

TUNING: DGCFAD (down one full step)

Dm9       Bbadd4       E7sus4       Ebmaj7sus4

    Dm9
You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need
            Bbadd4
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
                                                     E7sus4
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed

And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
Ebmaj7sus4
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking

Dm9
And after a while, you can work on points for style
          Bbadd4
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake

A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
    E7sus4
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
         Ebmaj7sus4
So that when they turn their backs on you
                                 Dm9       Bbadd4   E7sus4   Ebmaj7sus4
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

Dm9       Bbadd4       E7sus4       Ebmaj7sus4

     Dm9 
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
                 Bbadd4
You know it's going to get harder, harder, and harder as you get older
               E7sus4
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack, fly down south, hide your head in the sand
Ebmaj7sus4                                             Dm9 
Just another sad old man all alone and dying of cancer ah ah

Bbadd4       E7sus4       Ebmaj7sus4   Em 
Em  D   Em   D   Em  D  C          G  F  G  F  Em

Em Dm9  Em Dm9  Em Dm9 ...  C Em9/C  C Em9/C  C(III) B  B G  G/F# Em
Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em 
C D7  C D7  C D7  C7 D7
Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em 
C D7  C D7  C D7  B  B   B G G/F# Em

Em Em/G Em/F# Em    Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em            Em Em/G Em/F# Em
And when you loose control,   you'll reap the harvest that you've sown
Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em          C     B7  B G G#/F# Em
And as the fear grows,      the bad blood slows and turns to stone---
Em Em/G Em/F# Em     Em Em/G Em/F# Em  Em Em/G Em/F# Em            Em Em/G Em/F# Em
And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around
           C     D           C   D    C B
So have a good drown, as you go down alone
 B       G   G/F#   Em
Dragged down by the stone stone stone stone stone stone stone...

Dm9   Bbadd4    E7sus4   Ebmaj7sus4  

   Dm9
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Bbadd4
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
E7sus4
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
     Ebmaj7sus4
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?

Dm9
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
     Bbadd4
That everyone's expendable and no-one had a real friend
        E7sus4
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
                                     Ebmaj7sus4
Everything's done under the sun, and you believe at heart, everyone's a killer

Dm9      Bbadd4     E7sus4     Ebmaj7sus4   Em
Em  D   Em   D   Em  D  C        G  F  G  F  Em

          G         G/F#        Em     D    
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a seat in the stand
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
         G      G/F#  Em     C    B7
Who was dragged down by the stone
          B7     G   G/F#    Em
Who was dragged down by the stone

ANOTHER NOTE:  I thought I'd take the hints from the previous posting and
figure out the rest of the song.  Not sure at all about the middle
instrumental part- I did that kind of quickly.
