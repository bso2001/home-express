Learning to Fly  (Gilmour, Ezrin, Moore, Carin)
---------------
G  A/G  G  Gmaj7  Em7  D

G              A/G   G         Gmaj7
Into the distance, a ribbon of black

Em7                                       D
Stretched to the point of no turning back

G              A/G     G         Gmaj7
A flight of fancy on a windswept field

Em7                              D
Standing alone my senses reeled

G                A/G  G           Gmaj7
A fatal attraction is holding me fast, how

Em7                                    D
Can I escape this irresistible grasp?


C                  Em/B        Am         G
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky

F                               C           D
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

G  A/G  G  Gmaj7


G          A/G        G          Gmaj7
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings

Em7                                         D
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything

G          A/G  G              Gmaj7
No navigator to guide my way home

Em7                                  D
Unladened, empty and turned to stone


C              Em/B      Am               G
A soul in tension that's learning to fly

F                           C
Condition grounded but determined to try

                   Em/B        Am           G
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies

F                               C           D
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

F  Am7  D9  D


G
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,

Em7
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air,

G
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly

Em7
Out of the corner of my watering eye

G
A dream unthreatened by the morning light

Em7
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night


C                 Em/B  Am                 G
There's no sensation to compare with this

   F                   C
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

                   Em/B        Am          G
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies

F                               C           D
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

The Dogs of War  (Gilmour, Moore)
---------------
Cm
Dogs of war and men of hate, with no cause, we don't disciminate
Discovery is to be disowned, our currency is flesh and bone

Ebm
Hell opened up and put on sale, gather 'round and haggle

Cm
For hard cash, we will lie and decieve
Even our masters don't know the web we weave

Ab                              Fm
One world, it's a battleground. One world, and we will smash it down.

Cm
One world... One world


Cm
Invisable transfers, long distance calls, hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar has unleashed the dogs of war

Ebm
You can't stop what has begun, signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion

Cm
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

Ab                              Fm
One world, it's a battleground. One world, and they smash it down.

Cm
One world... One world

Cm7  F/C  Ebm  Ebm7  Dm7  Dbm7  Cm7  F/C  Cm7  F/C  Ab  Fm  Gsus4
Cm7  Ab  Fm  G  Cm


Cm
The dogs of war don't negotiate, the dogs of war won't capitulate,
They will take and you will give, and you must die so that they may live

Ebm
You can knock at any door,
But wherever you go, you now they've been there before

Cm
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

Ab
One world, it's a battleground

Fm7                     G7sus4
One world, are we gonna smash it down

Cm
One world... One world


One Slip  (Gilmour, Manzanera)
--------
Eb                            Gm(add4)
A restless eye across a weary room

Eb                                       Fsus4
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin

    C                                              Eb6  Eb
The music played and played as we whirled without end

F                       Ab(add9)
No hint, no word her honour to defend


Eb                                Gm(add4)
I will, I will she sighed to my request

                 Eb                                             Fsus4 F Fsus4
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test

     C                                       Eb
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire, I lead the way to the funeral pyre

        F
And without a thought of the consequence, I gave into my decadence


C(add9)                          Ebmaj7/Bb
One slip, and down the hole we fall

   Bb(add9)                  Gm(add9)
It seems to take no time at all

  C(add9)                            Ebmaj7/Bb
A momentary lapse of reason, that binds a life for life

    Bb(add9)                               Gm(add9)
A small regret, you won't forget, there'll be no sleep in here tonight.

Eb  Gm/D  Gm  Eb  Gm/D  Gm


Eb                                       Gm(add4)
Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?

              Eb                                              Fsus4  F  Fsus4
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?

    C                                         Eb
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown

    F
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

C(add9)                          Ebmaj7/Bb
One slip, and down the hole we fall.

   Bb(add9)                  Gm(add9)
It seems to take no time at all

  C(add9)                            Ebmaj7/Bb
A momentary lapse of reason, that binds life to a life

    Bb(add9)                                   Gm(add9)
The one regret you will never forget, there'll be no sleep in here tonight

Eb  Gm/D  Gm  Eb  Gm/D  Gm


On the Turning Away  (Gilmour, Moore)
-------------------
N.C.
On the turning away from the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say which we won't understand
"Don't accept that what's happening is just a case of others' suffering
Or you'll find that you're joining in the turning away"

Em     D/F#          G            C           Em
It's a sin that some how light is changing to shadow

    D/F#        G           C
And casting its shroud over all we have known

Em              C          G      Em             G        C
Unaware how the ranks have grown, driven on by a heart of stone

G                        C    Em          D/F#         G
We could find that we're all alone in the dream of the proud.


Em     D/F#         G            C           Em
On the wings of the night as the day time is stirring

          D/F#        G         C
Where the speachless unite in a silent accord

Em                   C        G           Em                 G         C
Using words you will find are strange and mesmerized as they light the flame

G                    C     Em      D/F#         G
Feel the new wind of change on the wings of the night

Em  D  Cmaj7  C  D  Em  Am  G/B  Cmaj7  D  Am  G  Cmaj7  D  Em


Em               G            C            Em
No more turning away from the weak and the weary

        D/F#     G            C
No more turning away from the coldness inside

Em                   C        G           Em                 G         C
Just a world that we all must share, it's not enough just to stand and stare

G            C                   Em         D/F#     G     D/F#
Is it only a dream that there'll be no more turning away?

Em  C  Em  D  G  D/F#


Yet Another Movie  (Gilmour, Leonard)
-----------------
Dm  C  Gm  Dm

Dm
One sound, one single sound

C
One kiss, one single kiss

  Gm
A face outside the window pane

   Dm
However did it come to this?


  Dm
A man who ran, a child who cried

    C
A girl who heard, a voice that lied

      Gm
The sun that burned a fiery red

    Dm                        C  Gm  Dm
The vision of an empty bed


    Dm
The use of force, he was so tough

       C
She'll soon submit, she's had enough

    Gm
The march of fate, the broken will

    Dm
Someone is lying very still


Dm
He has laughed and he has cried

C
He has fought and he has died

        Gm
He's just the same as all the rest

     Dm
He's not the worst, he's not the best

Dm  C  Gm  Dm


    Dm
And still this ceaseless murmuring

    C
The babbling that I brook

    Gm
The seas of faces, eyes upraised

    Dm
The empty screen, the vacant look


  Dm
A man in black on a snow white horse,

       C
A pointless life has run its course,

        Gm
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run

      Dm
As he fades into the setting sun

Dm  C  Gm  Dm


Round And Around  (Gilmour)

A New Machine Part One  (Gilmour)
----------------------
Cm9
I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind the eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime
Feels like more than a lifetime

Sometimes I get tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way it has always been?
Could it ever have been different?

Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever,
Nobody lives forever

A New Machine Part Two  (Gilmour)

I will always be in here
I will always look out from behind these eyes
It's only a lifetime
It's only a lifetime
It's only a lifetime


Sorrow  (Gilmour)
------
Em  D/E  Em  D/E  Em  D/E  C/E  Em  D/E  Em  D/E

Em
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land

D/E
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:

C/E
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers,

     Em                         D/E                 Em  D/E
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking


     Em
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise,

       D/E
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise

     C/E
He's chained forever to a world that's departed

     Em                            D/E
It's not enough, it's not enough.


    Em
His blood has frozen & curdled with fright

    D/E
His knees have trembled & given way in the night

    C/E
His hand is weakend at the moment of truth

    Em                   D/E  Em  D/E
His step has faltered.


Bm  A/B   D/A   Bm/F#   F#m
One world,      one     soul.

Bm   A/B  A    Bm/F# F#m
Time pass, the river rolls.

Gmaj7  D/A  Gmaj7  D/A  N.C./B  A/B  N.C./B  Bm
Gmaj7  D/A  Gmaj7  D/A  N.C./B  A/B  N.C./B  Bm  A/B


       Em
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication

    D/E
And silent replies that swirl invitation

C/E
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea

  Em                 D/E             Em  D/E
A grim intimation of what is to be.

           Em
There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night

            D/E
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight

    C/E
And silence that speaks so much louder than words,

   Em                D/E
Of promises broken.

Em  D/E  Em  D/E
