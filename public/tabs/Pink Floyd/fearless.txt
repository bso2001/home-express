FEARLESS- Pink Floyd

TUNING: D G D G B D (open G)

RIFF FOUR TIMES   C Bb   G  C Bb

  G                                    C Bb
You say the hill's too steep to climb
  G         C Bb
Climb it!
  G                                C Bb
You say you'd like to see me try
  G       C Bb
Climb it!
  A                                      D
You pick the place and I'll choose the time
           G                    C
And I'll climb that hill in my own way
  G                          C
Just wait a while, for the right day
           G              C         
And as I rise above the treeline and the clouds
         D              C                            G
I look down, hear the sound of the things you said today

RIFF 4 TIMES

BRIDGE(slide up and down to these shapes):
Bm Am Bm Am Bm Am Bm Am

G  C Bb   G  C Bb

Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless, the magistrate turns round
Frowning
And who's the fool who wears the crown
And go down in your own way
And everyday is the right day
And as you rise above the fearlines in the frown
You look down
Hear the sound of the faces in the crowd

REPEAT RIFF FOREVER
