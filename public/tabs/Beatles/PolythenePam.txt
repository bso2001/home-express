According to _Beatles Complete_ (Hal Leonard publishing, 1987 - a most
questionable source):

POLYTHENE PAM
(The Beatles)
D/E  A  E  (x 2)
E                   D   A         E
   Well, you should see Polythene Pam
                  D              A            E
   She's so good looking but she looks like a man
                      G                             B
   Well, you should see her in drag, dressed in her polythene bag
                   C   D         E
   Yes, you should see Polythene Pam.
   C     D     E
   Yeah, yeah, yeah

D/E  A  E (x 2)

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the _News of the World_
Yes, you could say she was attractively built.
Yeah, yeah, yeah

D/E  A  E (x2)
D  A  E  (x 9?)

[Geez, while I'm at it, here's She Came in through the Bathroom Window.
Same source:] ltrics corrected by Charlie_Gibbs@mindlink.bc.ca

A                                 D
 She came in through the bathroom window
A          F#m         D
 protected by a silver spoon
A            F#m                 D
 But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
        D7                      A
 by the banks of her own lagoon

(A)                Dm
Didn't anybody tell her?
A                   Dm
Didn't anybody see?
G7                       C
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
G7                        C        (go to 2/4 for the C)
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
Worked in fifteen clubs a day
And though I thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew but I could not say

So I quit the police department
and got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
she could steal but she could not rob

Chorus

[Hope this isn't too far wrong]
