Guitar Details During Verses:

.. and so on, while Guitar 2 plays something along these lines:
       B

Guitar 2 plays this figure during the "chorus":

                 B             E

  ... it's gonna be         alright

.. repeated a few times, and then the following turnaround:

    F#7
-|-----------------------------------------------------------
-|-----------------------------------------------------------
-|-----------------------------------------------------------
-|-------------2----------4----------2-----------------------
-|--------2h4--------2h4--------2h4-------------2------------
-|--2--2----------2----------2----------2--2h4---------------


Now, over the A B G# chords in the last verse, the lead guitar
plays a screaming figure based on this:

-|-----------14----
-|--14b(16)--------
-|-----------------
-|-----------------
-|-----------------
-|-----------------

And over the B & E chords the final time around, the lead guitar
is rapidly picking in rhythm with the words:

-|--9--------------
-|--12b(14)--------
-|-----------------
-|-----------------
-|-----------------
-|-----------------

.. up until the climactic end.

[me again!]

well, no-one seems to have done this, so I'll give it a shot... it's pretty
hard to describe exactly what's going on with the rhythm here... and it's also
hard to play along with (if I remember correctly, the distorted (single) 
version is tuned to somewhere between 2 and 3 half-steps up (yeah, it's just
"randomly somewhere in between" - try it!), and I think the acoustic 
version on the White Album is maybe 1 or 2 half-steps up... at any rate,
I'll tab it in A because it's easiest (only possible ?) to play that way.

(also, I really never figured out the lead part... if someone would
care to chip in [or maybe I'll get around to it someday])

Intro is something like

 (keep sliding up to this A chord for awhile)
E------ ....  ------
B--\9-- ....  --12^-
G--\10= ....  ------

my best approximation of how the rhythm goes is something like this... you'll
have to play around hitting those notes on the 4th fret and then letting the
whole chord ring out:
 A                       (ring)        D            A     (ring)
-----------     -------------------------------     -------------------
-----------     ---------2-----------2-3-3-3---     ---------2-------2-
----------- ... ---------2-----------2-2-2-2h4- ... ---------2-------2- ...
-2-2-2h4-2-     -2-2-2h4-2-----2-2h4---0-0-0---     -2-2-2h4-2-2-2h4---
-0-0-0---0-     -0-0-0---------0-0-------------     -0-0-0-----0-0-----
-----------     -------------------------------     -------------------

anyways, it eventually makes it to E with the same kind of pattern... most 
of the funny business is stuff with the A where you do the 2(hammer)4 on
other strings [a few right in a row], and a 0h4 on the open string, usually
ending with a strum of the A chord...  so...
    A                                   D
You say you want a Revolution, well you know
                          A
We all want to change the world
                                          D
You tell me that it's evolution, well you know
                          E(7?)
We all want to change the world

Bm                           E
  but when you talk about destruction
Bm                            G     A  F#   E
  don't you know that you can count me out


(much more funny business with the notes on the 4th fret in this part:)
                            A     D         A...
  don't you know it's gonna be... alright...

and...

D---------0---------2-
A-----0h2-----2-2h4---  (x2)...
E-0-0-----------------

You say you got a real solution, well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution, well you know
We're all doing what we can...

But if you want money for minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be...

You say you'll change the constitution, well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution, well you know
You better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow...
Don't you know it's gonna be...


anyone else is free to help out with this one!
