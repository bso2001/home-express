SEXY SADIE is a beautiful and great song that is easly to play. Heard the CD
for better comprehension and take to joy to play it. Thanks to Ole Christian
Engkrog for his remark about this sound. "Sexy Sadie" is too me one of the
greatest song I've ever heard. Also, he wrote chords of Real Love. One last
thing, I work presently a littles bit of guitar that listend before the fade,
ie with the chords at the end. Now! play an let you take away by the song.
PEACE on Earth for everyboby!
