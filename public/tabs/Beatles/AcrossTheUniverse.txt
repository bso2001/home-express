
ACROSS THE UNIVERSE- The Beatles

D Dmaj7 A

D                 Dmaj7              F#m            
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
     Em7                                 A                 A7
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe 
D                 Dmaj7             F#m               
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
   Em7           Gm
Possessing and caressing me 

CHORUS:
D             Em7/A
Jai Guru Deva Om 
A7
Nothing's gonna change my world
G/D                       D
Nothing's gonna change my world 
A7    
Nothing's gonna change my world
G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world 

   D       Dmaj7               F#m
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
 Em7                      A          A7
They call me on and on across the universe
   D              Dmaj7           F#m 
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
       Em7                              A              A7
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe 
...CHORUS 

  D                   Dmaj7              F#m
Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing through my opened ears
   Em7          Gm
Inciting and inviting me
  D          Dmaj7             F#m                            Em7 
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
                         A          A7
And calls me on and on across the universe 
...CHORUS 

D
Jai Guru Deva   (Repeat)
