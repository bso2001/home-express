Chords by: Chris Bray (cbray@comp.uark.edu)
Additional help by: Jim Bradbury (jbradbury@macuser.ziff.com)
and Bradley T. Heim


Intro:  [Play muffled strings a bit, then:]   B  F#  E    (x8)

{Continue  B  F#  E progression}
You don't know how you move me
Deconstruct me
And consume me
I'm all used up
I'm out of luck
I am starstruck
B                    F#           E               B
By something in your eyes that is keeping my hope alive

                E                       F#
But I'm sick of myself when I look at you
                B           E
Something is beautiful and true
                   E         F#
In a world that's ugly and a lie
                B          E
It's hard to even want to try
                        E    F#
And I'm beginning to think        Baby you don't know


{Continue  B  F#  E progression}
I'll take or leave
The room to breathe
The choice to leave you
I'll throw away
A chance at greatness
Just to make this
B               F#            E                   B
Dream come into play, I don't know if I'll find a way

                   E                       F#
'Cause I'm sick of myself when I look at you
                B           E
Something is beautiful and true
                   E         F#
In a world that's ugly and a lie
                B          E
It's hard to even want to try
                        E  F#                    G#m
And I'm beginning to think       Baby you don't know
                  E     F#
I'm beginning to think        Baby you don't know

B                         F#           E               B
There's something in your eyes that is keeping my hope alive
                E                        F#
But I'm sick of myself when I look at you
                B           E
Something is beautiful and true
                   E          F#
In a world that's ugly and a lie
                B          E
It's hard to even want to try
                        E  F#
And I'm beginning to think      Baby you don't know
                    E  F#
I'm beginning to think          Baby you don't know
