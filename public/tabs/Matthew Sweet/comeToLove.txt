"Come to Love"

Transcribed by: Brad Heim


Intro:  B   A

E   A   E   A

           E     A
You try to win
                E
At a game that has no winners
            E     A
You try to learn
        B               A
When nothing can be understood
            E     A
You try to feel
           Abm       Dbm
When all feeling is gone

                 B      A
And you come to love
                 E      A
What you used to hate
             B     A
You come to find
                E       A
What you threw away


E    A    E    A


You thought that time
Would be your rock
And now this time
It is unlocked
Time will fly
If you can't let it go

                 B      A
And you come to love
                 E      A
What you used to hate
             B     A
You come to find
                E       A
What you threw away


E    A    E    A


Dbm
When will you discover
         B
who you really are inside
Dbm
Follow any other reason
     B            A
you won't be satisfied


If time will fly
If you can't let it go
And you come to love
What you used to hate
You come to find
What you threw away

And you won't wait for long
'Cause you come to love
What you used to hate
