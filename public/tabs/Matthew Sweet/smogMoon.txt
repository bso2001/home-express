Intro:  Eb

Eb
There's a smog moon, in the amber sky, wavering and burning like a golden lie.
Eb        G5                      Ab      Bb
I fell so far, I didn't think I'd make it back
Eb
We are all made, as an afterthought,
Destined to believe that we are what we are not
Eb     G5                            Ab  Bb
I'm afraid, but I don't need to tell you that


Chorus:
Eb
There's a smog moon coming I can always feel it
Bb
The cartoon trees cannot conceal it
Ab                       Cm                Bb             Cm
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white
Ab                       Cm                 Bb
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like


Eb
There's a lost man, with a bitter soul, Only for a moment,
Did life make him whole
Eb           G5                       Ab   Bb
And while he was, he thought he was invincible


Chorus:
Eb
There's a smog moon coming I can always feel it
Bb
The cartoon trees cannot conceal it

When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white
Ab                        Cm              Bb                  Eb
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white


{Break}:  Eb


Bridge:
Gm                Ab               Bb           Cm
They're not your words, but you're reciting the lines
Gm                Ab               Bb           Cm
You don't mean a thing, but you exist in their minds
Gm           Ab                     Bb          Cm
How does it feel, when they have turned out the lights?
Gm           Ab                              Bb          Eb
'Cause you know they sooner would get rid of you, than fight.


Eb
And the dark night, has the strongest pull
We both know that staying young, can take its toll
Eb        G5                          Ab   Bb
Are you afraid of finding out you're over that


Chorus:
Eb
There's a smog moon coming I can always feel it
Bb
The cartoon trees cannot conceal it
Ab                       Cm                 Bb              Cm
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white
Ab                       Cm                 Bb              Cm
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white
Ab                       Cm                 Bb              Cm
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like it is white
Ab                       Cm                   Bb         Eb
When it's high up in the sky, it almost looks like
