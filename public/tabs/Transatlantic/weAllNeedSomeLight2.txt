TRANSATLANTIC  "We All Need Some Light"   (Chord Progression)

transcribed by Florian Rau (florian_rau@gmx.de)

Verse
[C#] Some people [B] think think they have [F#] none
They might as well [D#m] stay down
[C#] Running In [B] circles like bulls in a [F#] ring
Til the sword finds its [D#m]way [C#]down
 
Bridge
While the [G#m] creep beats the rap on [D#m]appeal
and the [G#m] cop who can't stop shows the [B] kids how to [C#] steal
 
Refrain
And we [D#m] all need some [F#] light [C#]now
[B] We all need some [F#] light [C#] now
'Cause we [D#m] all need some [F#] light [C#] now
[B] Turn on your [F#] light and wash the [C#] darkness [D#m] away
