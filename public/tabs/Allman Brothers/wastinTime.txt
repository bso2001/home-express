Ain't Wastin' Time No More Tab

Last Sunday morning the sunshine 
Felt like rain 
The week before they all 
Seemed the same 
 
With the help of God and two friends 
I've come to realize 
I still have two strong legs 
And eagles wings to fly 
 
         E         B/D#                        C# 
No, I ain't wastin' time no more 
                                          ?cause 
 
F# 
Time goes by like 
 
(back to B A/B vamp) 
 
Hurricanes and faster things 
 
Lord, lord, Miss Sally 
Why all your crying 
Been around here three long days 
Looking like you're dying 
 
Just step yourself outside and Look up at the stars above 
Go on downtown baby 
Find somebody to love 
 
Meanwhile I ain't wastin' time 
                                               no more 
Cause time goes by like 
Pouring rain 
And much faster things 
 
          E 
And you don't need              B 
             no gypsy to tell you why 
          E 
You can't let one precious B 
                                   day slip by 
        E 
But look inside yourself if you 
B 
Don't see what you want 
               F# 
Maybe sometimes then you don't 
E  
Leave your mind alone
