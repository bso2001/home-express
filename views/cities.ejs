				One day in 1987, Frank had the idea to compose an album's worth of drum box parts,
				then hand them over as the foundation of music to be subsequently produced.
				There was no coordination or discussion of what the music would sound like.
				It just had to fit over the 42 minutes of manic drum box parts.
				Those drum parts, by the way, were all written out.
				Frank showed up with like a hundred pages of hand-written sheet music.
				He then tapped these parts into a Roland TR-505 drum box.
				Crazy.
			</p>

			<p>
				The music was "recorded" on the venerable Tascam 22-4, with three live tracks; the fourth was used as an FSK sync track.
				The live tracks contained all the guitar parts, some real bass guitar, a few keys, some noises.
				The FSK track served as MIDI synchronization, driving the drum box and a Yamaha QX-5 sequencer,
				which contained most of the keyboard parts.
				Most of the keys were thus programmed and not played, and the Casio FZ-1 sampler was heavily used.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, the mix: I had no automation then (not for mixing anyway),
				and there were tons of both live and MIDI-driven parts coming at me.
				If it sounds at all coherent it is a miracle.
