				I met Ray Nering in grade school when we were 12 or 14 or like that.
				Soon thereafter, we were trying to make music.
				Not many years later, we met drummer Frank Romond, and by the mid-to-late 70's, we were a band we called <i>Providence</i>.
			</div>
			<div class="description small">
				Mark Dobry soon joined as the bass player.
				Ansel Spada became the singer.
				Dana Vagovsky and Dean Rubine played keyboards on some projects.
			</div>
			<div class="description small">
				For ten years or so, we recorded lots of originals, all of them on analog tape.
				And all these guys were a big part of my life through all those years.

			<div class="description small">
				Beginning in the late 70's, a series of rather insane improvisations took place.
				Initially, these were perpetrated by Ray Nering and myself. Frank Romond and Lee Walsh would ultimately become complicit as well.
				Many others wandered in at one time or another, lending both spiritual and musical support.
			</div>
			<div class="description small">
				Early on, Ray termed these sessions "Gas Music from Jupiter" (from the Firesign Theatre album <i>Everything You Know is Wrong</i>).
				Gas Music gatherings were a fairly regular thing throughout the 80's.
			</div>
			<div class="description small"> There have been some 20 GMFJ meetings. An attempt will be made to document as many as possible. </div>
